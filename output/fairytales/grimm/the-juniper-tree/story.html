        <div class="story-content">
            <p>Long, long ago, some two thousand years or so, there lived a rich</p>
<p>man with a good and beautiful wife. They loved each other dearly, but</p>
<p>sorrowed much that they had no children. So greatly did they desire</p>
<p>to have one, that the wife prayed for it day and night, but still they</p>
<p>remained childless.</p>
<p>In front of the house there was a court, in which grew a juniper-tree.</p>
<p>One winter’s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples, and</p>
<p>as she was peeling them, she cut her finger, and the blood fell on the</p>
<p>snow. ‘Ah,’ sighed the woman heavily, ‘if I had but a child, as red as</p>
<p>blood and as white as snow,’ and as she spoke the words, her heart grew</p>
<p>light within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and</p>
<p>she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted. A month passed,</p>
<p>and the snow had all disappeared; then another month went by, and all</p>
<p>the earth was green. So the months followed one another, and first the</p>
<p>trees budded in the woods, and soon the green branches grew thickly</p>
<p>intertwined, and then the blossoms began to fall. Once again the wife</p>
<p>stood under the juniper-tree, and it was so full of sweet scent that her</p>
<p>heart leaped for joy, and she was so overcome with her happiness, that</p>
<p>she fell on her knees. Presently the fruit became round and firm, and</p>
<p>she was glad and at peace; but when they were fully ripe she picked the</p>
<p>berries and ate eagerly of them, and then she grew sad and ill. A little</p>
<p>while later she called her husband, and said to him, weeping. ‘If I</p>
<p>die, bury me under the juniper-tree.’ Then she felt comforted and happy</p>
<p>again, and before another month had passed she had a little child, and</p>
<p>when she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood, her joy</p>
<p>was so great that she died.</p>
<p>Her husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for</p>
<p>her. By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he</p>
<p>still grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later</p>
<p>on he married again.</p>
<p>He now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife</p>
<p>was a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow. The mother</p>
<p>loved her daughter very much, and when she looked at her and then looked</p>
<p>at the boy, it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in</p>
<p>the way of her own child, and she was continually thinking how she could</p>
<p>get the whole of the property for her. This evil thought took possession</p>
<p>of her more and more, and made her behave very unkindly to the boy. She</p>
<p>drove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings, so that the</p>
<p>poor child went about in fear, and had no peace from the time he left</p>
<p>school to the time he went back.</p>
<p>One day the little daughter came running to her mother in the</p>
<p>store-room, and said, ‘Mother, give me an apple.’ ‘Yes, my child,’ said</p>
<p>the wife, and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; the chest</p>
<p>had a very heavy lid and a large iron lock.</p>
<p>‘Mother,’ said the little daughter again, ‘may not brother have one</p>
<p>too?’ The mother was angry at this, but she answered, ‘Yes, when he</p>
<p>comes out of school.’</p>
<p>Just then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and it seemed</p>
<p>as if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the apple out</p>
<p>of her little daughter’s hand, and said, ‘You shall not have one before</p>
<p>your brother.’ She threw the apple into the chest and shut it to. The</p>
<p>little boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife made her say</p>
<p>kindly to him, ‘My son, will you have an apple?’ but she gave him a</p>
<p>wicked look. ‘Mother,’ said the boy, ‘how dreadful you look! Yes, give</p>
<p>me an apple.’ The thought came to her that she would kill him. ‘Come</p>
<p>with me,’ she said, and she lifted up the lid of the chest; ‘take one</p>
<p>out for yourself.’ And as he bent over to do so, the evil spirit urged</p>
<p>her, and crash! down went the lid, and off went the little boy’s head.</p>
<p>Then she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought of what she had done.</p>
<p>‘If only I can prevent anyone knowing that I did it,’ she thought. So</p>
<p>she went upstairs to her room, and took a white handkerchief out of</p>
<p>her top drawer; then she set the boy’s head again on his shoulders, and</p>
<p>bound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and placed</p>
<p>him on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand.</p>
<p>Soon after this, little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirring</p>
<p>a pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, ‘Mother, brother is</p>
<p>sitting by the door with an apple in his hand, and he looks so pale;</p>
<p>and when I asked him to give me the apple, he did not answer, and that</p>
<p>frightened me.’</p>
<p>‘Go to him again,’ said her mother, ‘and if he does not answer, give him</p>
<p>a box on the ear.’ So little Marleen went, and said, ‘Brother, give me</p>
<p>that apple,’ but he did not say a word; then she gave him a box on the</p>
<p>ear, and his head rolled off. She was so terrified at this, that she ran</p>
<p>crying and screaming to her mother. ‘Oh!’ she said, ‘I have knocked off</p>
<p>brother’s head,’ and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her.</p>
<p>‘What have you done!’ said her mother, ‘but no one must know about it,</p>
<p>so you must keep silence; what is done can’t be undone; we will make</p>
<p>him into puddings.’ And she took the little boy and cut him up, made him</p>
<p>into puddings, and put him in the pot. But Marleen stood looking on,</p>
<p>and wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no</p>
<p>need of salt.</p>
<p>Presently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked,</p>
<p>‘Where is my son?’ The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of</p>
<p>black pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing.</p>
<p>The father again asked, ‘Where is my son?’</p>
<p>‘Oh,’ answered the wife, ‘he is gone into the country to his mother’s</p>
<p>great uncle; he is going to stay there some time.’</p>
<p>‘What has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to me!’</p>
<p>‘Well, he likes being there, and he told me he should be away quite six</p>
<p>weeks; he is well looked after there.’</p>
<p>‘I feel very unhappy about it,’ said the husband, ‘in case it should not</p>
<p>be all right, and he ought to have said goodbye to me.’</p>
<p>With this he went on with his dinner, and said, ‘Little Marleen, why do</p>
<p>you weep? Brother will soon be back.’ Then he asked his wife for more</p>
<p>pudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the table.</p>
<p>Little Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of</p>
<p>her bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the</p>
<p>table and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but</p>
<p>weep. Then she laid them in the green grass under the juniper-tree, and</p>
<p>she had no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to leave her,</p>
<p>and she wept no more. And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the</p>
<p>branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and</p>
<p>then together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for</p>
<p>joy. After this a mist came round the tree, and in the midst of it there</p>
<p>was a burning as of fire, and out of the fire there flew a beautiful</p>
<p>bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, and when it</p>
<p>could no more be seen, the juniper-tree stood there as before, and the</p>
<p>silk handkerchief and the bones were gone.</p>
<p>Little Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were</p>
<p>still alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to</p>
<p>the table and ate.</p>
<p>The bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began to</p>
<p>sing:</p>
<p>‘My mother killed her little son;</p>
<p>My father grieved when I was gone;</p>
<p>My sister loved me best of all;</p>
<p>She laid her kerchief over me,</p>
<p>And took my bones that they might lie</p>
<p>Underneath the juniper-tree</p>
<p>Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’</p>
<p>The goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain, when he heard the</p>
<p>song of the bird on his roof. He thought it so beautiful that he got</p>
<p>up and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his</p>
<p>slippers. But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on</p>
<p>one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still</p>
<p>held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing</p>
<p>up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.</p>
<p>‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing! Sing me that song again.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing. Give that gold</p>
<p>chain, and I will sing it you again.’</p>
<p>‘Here is the chain, take it,’ said the goldsmith. ‘Only sing me that</p>
<p>again.’</p>
<p>The bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw, and then</p>
<p>he alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang:</p>
<p>‘My mother killed her little son;</p>
<p>My father grieved when I was gone;</p>
<p>My sister loved me best of all;</p>
<p>She laid her kerchief over me,</p>
<p>And took my bones that they might lie</p>
<p>Underneath the juniper-tree</p>
<p>Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’</p>
<p>Then he flew away, and settled on the roof of a shoemaker’s house and</p>
<p>sang:</p>
<p>‘My mother killed her little son;</p>
<p>My father grieved when I was gone;</p>
<p>My sister loved me best of all;</p>
<p>She laid her kerchief over me,</p>
<p>And took my bones that they might lie</p>
<p>Underneath the juniper-tree</p>
<p>Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’</p>
<p>The shoemaker heard him, and he jumped up and ran out in his</p>
<p>shirt-sleeves, and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his</p>
<p>hand over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun.</p>
<p>‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing!’ Then he called through the</p>
<p>door to his wife: ‘Wife, come out; here is a bird, come and look at it</p>
<p>and hear how beautifully it sings.’ Then he called his daughter and the</p>
<p>children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the</p>
<p>street to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red</p>
<p>and green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two</p>
<p>bright stars in its head.</p>
<p>‘Bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘sing me that song again.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; you must</p>
<p>give me something.’</p>
<p>‘Wife,’ said the man, ‘go into the garret; on the upper shelf you will</p>
<p>see a pair of red shoes; bring them to me.’ The wife went in and fetched</p>
<p>the shoes.</p>
<p>‘There, bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘now sing me that song again.’</p>
<p>The bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then he</p>
<p>went back to the roof and sang:</p>
<p>‘My mother killed her little son;</p>
<p>My father grieved when I was gone;</p>
<p>My sister loved me best of all;</p>
<p>She laid her kerchief over me,</p>
<p>And took my bones that they might lie</p>
<p>Underneath the juniper-tree</p>
<p>Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’</p>
<p>When he had finished, he flew away. He had the chain in his right claw</p>
<p>and the shoes in his left, and he flew right away to a mill, and the</p>
<p>mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click clack.’ Inside the mill were</p>
<p>twenty of the miller’s men hewing a stone, and as they went ‘Hick hack,</p>
<p>hick hack, hick hack,’ the mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click</p>
<p>clack.’</p>
<p>The bird settled on a lime-tree in front of the mill and sang:</p>
<p>‘My mother killed her little son;</p>
<p>then one of the men left off,</p>
<p>My father grieved when I was gone;</p>
<p>two more men left off and listened,</p>
<p>My sister loved me best of all;</p>
<p>then four more left off,</p>
<p>She laid her kerchief over me,</p>
<p>And took my bones that they might lie</p>
<p>now there were only eight at work,</p>
<p>Underneath</p>
<p>And now only five,</p>
<p>the juniper-tree.</p>
<p>And now only one,</p>
<p>Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’</p>
<p>then he looked up and the last one had left off work.</p>
<p>‘Bird,’ he said, ‘what a beautiful song that is you sing! Let me hear it</p>
<p>too; sing it again.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; give me that</p>
<p>millstone, and I will sing it again.’</p>
<p>‘If it belonged to me alone,’ said the man, ‘you should have it.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, yes,’ said the others: ‘if he will sing again, he can have it.’</p>
<p>The bird came down, and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up the</p>
<p>stone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole and took</p>
<p>the stone round his neck like a collar, and flew back with it to the</p>
<p>tree and sang--</p>
<p>‘My mother killed her little son;</p>
<p>My father grieved when I was gone;</p>
<p>My sister loved me best of all;</p>
<p>She laid her kerchief over me,</p>
<p>And took my bones that they might lie</p>
<p>Underneath the juniper-tree</p>
<p>Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’</p>
<p>And when he had finished his song, he spread his wings, and with the</p>
<p>chain in his right claw, the shoes in his left, and the millstone round</p>
<p>his neck, he flew right away to his father’s house.</p>
<p>The father, the mother, and little Marleen were having their dinner.</p>
<p>‘How lighthearted I feel,’ said the father, ‘so pleased and cheerful.’</p>
<p>‘And I,’ said the mother, ‘I feel so uneasy, as if a heavy thunderstorm</p>
<p>were coming.’</p>
<p>But little Marleen sat and wept and wept.</p>
<p>Then the bird came flying towards the house and settled on the roof.</p>
<p>‘I do feel so happy,’ said the father, ‘and how beautifully the sun</p>
<p>shines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.’</p>
<p>‘Ah!’ said the wife, ‘and I am so full of distress and uneasiness that</p>
<p>my teeth chatter, and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins,’ and</p>
<p>she tore open her dress; and all the while little Marleen sat in the</p>
<p>corner and wept, and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears.</p>
<p>The bird now flew to the juniper-tree and began singing:</p>
<p>‘My mother killed her little son;</p>
<p>the mother shut her eyes and her ears, that she might see and hear</p>
<p>nothing, but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of a</p>
<p>violent storm, and in her eyes a burning and flashing like lightning:</p>
<p>My father grieved when I was gone;</p>
<p>‘Look, mother,’ said the man, ‘at the beautiful bird that is singing so</p>
<p>magnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious</p>
<p>scent of spice in the air!’</p>
<p>My sister loved me best of all;</p>
<p>then little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed.</p>
<p>‘I must go outside and see the bird nearer,’ said the man.</p>
<p>‘Ah, do not go!’ cried the wife. ‘I feel as if the whole house were in</p>
<p>flames!’</p>
<p>But the man went out and looked at the bird.</p>
<p>She laid her kerchief over me,</p>
<p>And took my bones that they might lie</p>
<p>Underneath the juniper-tree</p>
<p>Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’</p>
<p>With that the bird let fall the gold chain, and it fell just round the</p>
<p>man’s neck, so that it fitted him exactly.</p>
<p>He went inside, and said, ‘See, what a splendid bird that is; he has</p>
<p>given me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself.’</p>
<p>But the wife was in such fear and trouble, that she fell on the floor,</p>
<p>and her cap fell from her head.</p>
<p>Then the bird began again:</p>
<p>‘My mother killed her little son;</p>
<p>‘Ah me!’ cried the wife, ‘if I were but a thousand feet beneath the</p>
<p>earth, that I might not hear that song.’</p>
<p>My father grieved when I was gone;</p>
<p>then the woman fell down again as if dead.</p>
<p>My sister loved me best of all;</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said little Marleen, ‘I will go out too and see if the bird will</p>
<p>give me anything.’</p>
<p>So she went out.</p>
<p>She laid her kerchief over me,</p>
<p>And took my bones that they might lie</p>
<p>and he threw down the shoes to her,</p>
<p>Underneath the juniper-tree</p>
<p>Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’</p>
<p>And she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and</p>
<p>danced and jumped about in them. ‘I was so miserable,’ she said, ‘when I</p>
<p>came out, but that has all passed away; that is indeed a splendid bird,</p>
<p>and he has given me a pair of red shoes.’</p>
<p>The wife sprang up, with her hair standing out from her head like flames</p>
<p>of fire. ‘Then I will go out too,’ she said, ‘and see if it will lighten</p>
<p>my misery, for I feel as if the world were coming to an end.’</p>
<p>But as she crossed the threshold, crash! the bird threw the millstone</p>
<p>down on her head, and she was crushed to death.</p>
<p>The father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they only</p>
<p>saw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these had</p>
<p>passed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and</p>
<p>little Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went</p>
<p>inside together and sat down to their dinners and ate.</p>
