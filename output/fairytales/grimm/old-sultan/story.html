        <div class="story-content">
            <p>A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old,</p>
<p>and had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife</p>
<p>were standing together before the house the shepherd said, ‘I will shoot</p>
<p>old Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.’ But his wife</p>
<p>said, ‘Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a</p>
<p>great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of</p>
<p>his days.’ ‘But what can we do with him?’ said the shepherd, ‘he has not</p>
<p>a tooth in his head, and the thieves don’t care for him at all; to</p>
<p>be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood;</p>
<p>tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.’</p>
<p>Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd</p>
<p>and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think</p>
<p>tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good</p>
<p>friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows,</p>
<p>and how his master meant to kill him in the morning. ‘Make yourself</p>
<p>easy,’ said the wolf, ‘I will give you some good advice. Your master,</p>
<p>you know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the</p>
<p>field; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down</p>
<p>behind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie</p>
<p>down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come</p>
<p>out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as</p>
<p>you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they</p>
<p>will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you</p>
<p>that they will take care of you as long as you live.’ The dog liked this</p>
<p>plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the</p>
<p>child a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan</p>
<p>soon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master</p>
<p>and mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, ‘Old</p>
<p>Sultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live</p>
<p>and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and</p>
<p>give him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on</p>
<p>as long as he lives.’ So from this time forward Sultan had all that he</p>
<p>could wish for.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, ‘Now, my</p>
<p>good fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way</p>
<p>when I want to taste one of the old shepherd’s fine fat sheep.’ ‘No,’</p>
<p>said the Sultan; ‘I will be true to my master.’ However, the wolf</p>
<p>thought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But</p>
<p>Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait</p>
<p>for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for</p>
<p>a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed</p>
<p>his locks for him finely.</p>
<p>Then the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan ‘an old rogue,’ and</p>
<p>swore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the</p>
<p>boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now</p>
<p>Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd’s old</p>
<p>three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped</p>
<p>along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.</p>
<p>The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they</p>
<p>espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat’s long tail standing</p>
<p>straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to</p>
<p>fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up</p>
<p>a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of</p>
<p>fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped</p>
<p>up into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and</p>
<p>wondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden</p>
<p>himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of</p>
<p>them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a</p>
<p>mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped</p>
<p>up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ‘Look up in the tree, there</p>
<p>sits the one who is to blame.’ So they looked up, and espied the wolf</p>
<p>sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,</p>
<p>and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of</p>
<p>himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.</p>
