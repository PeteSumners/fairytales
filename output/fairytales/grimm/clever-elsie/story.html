        <div class="story-content">
            <p>There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And</p>
<p>when she had grown up her father said: ‘We will get her married.’ ‘Yes,’</p>
<p>said the mother, ‘if only someone would come who would have her.’ At</p>
<p>length a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans;</p>
<p>but he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. ‘Oh,’ said</p>
<p>the father, ‘she has plenty of good sense’; and the mother said: ‘Oh,</p>
<p>she can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said Hans, ‘if she is not really smart, I won’t have her.’ When</p>
<p>they were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: ‘Elsie, go</p>
<p>into the cellar and fetch some beer.’ Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher</p>
<p>from the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she</p>
<p>went, so that the time might not appear long. When she was below she</p>
<p>fetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had</p>
<p>no need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected</p>
<p>injury. Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and</p>
<p>while the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but</p>
<p>looked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a</p>
<p>pick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>Then Clever Elsie began to weep and said: ‘If I get Hans, and we have</p>
<p>a child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw</p>
<p>beer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then she</p>
<p>sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the</p>
<p>misfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs waited for the drink,</p>
<p>but Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the servant:</p>
<p>‘Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.’ The maid went and</p>
<p>found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly. ‘Elsie why</p>
<p>do you weep?’ asked the maid. ‘Ah,’ she answered, ‘have I not reason to</p>
<p>weep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to</p>
<p>draw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill</p>
<p>him.’ Then said the maid: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down</p>
<p>beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a while,</p>
<p>as the maid did not come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the</p>
<p>beer, the man said to the boy: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see</p>
<p>where Elsie and the girl are.’ The boy went down, and there sat Clever</p>
<p>Elsie and the girl both weeping together. Then he asked: ‘Why are you</p>
<p>weeping?’ ‘Ah,’ said Elsie, ‘have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans,</p>
<p>and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the</p>
<p>pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then said the boy: ‘What</p>
<p>a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down by her, and likewise began to</p>
<p>howl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not</p>
<p>return, the man said to the woman: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see</p>
<p>where Elsie is!’ The woman went down, and found all three in the midst</p>
<p>of their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told</p>
<p>her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it</p>
<p>grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. Then said the</p>
<p>mother likewise: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down and wept</p>
<p>with them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not</p>
<p>come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: ‘I must go into the</p>
<p>cellar myself and see where Elsie is.’ But when he got into the cellar,</p>
<p>and they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and</p>
<p>that Elsie’s child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one</p>
<p>into the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if</p>
<p>he should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very</p>
<p>time when it fell down, he cried: ‘Oh, what a clever Elsie!’ and sat</p>
<p>down, and likewise wept with them. The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone</p>
<p>for a long time; then as no one would come back he thought: ‘They must be</p>
<p>waiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are about.’</p>
<p>When he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting</p>
<p>quite piteously, each out-doing the other. ‘What misfortune has happened</p>
<p>then?’ asked he. ‘Ah, dear Hans,’ said Elsie, ‘if we marry each other</p>
<p>and have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw</p>
<p>something to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might</p>
<p>dash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to</p>
<p>weep?’ ‘Come,’ said Hans, ‘more understanding than that is not needed</p>
<p>for my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,’ and</p>
<p>seized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.</p>
<p>After Hans had had her some time, he said: ‘Wife, I am going out to work</p>
<p>and earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we</p>
<p>may have some bread.’ ‘Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.’ After Hans had</p>
<p>gone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field</p>
<p>with her. When she came to the field she said to herself: ‘What shall I</p>
<p>do; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.’ Then</p>
<p>she drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once</p>
<p>more said: ‘What shall I do? Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first?</p>
<p>I will sleep first.’ Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.</p>
<p>Hans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said</p>
<p>he: ‘What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not</p>
<p>even come home to eat.’ But when evening came and she still stayed away,</p>
<p>Hans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she</p>
<p>was lying among the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought</p>
<p>a fowler’s net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she</p>
<p>still went on sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat</p>
<p>down in his chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever</p>
<p>Elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about</p>
<p>her, and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was</p>
<p>alarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or</p>
<p>not, and said: ‘Is it I, or is it not I?’ But she knew not what answer</p>
<p>to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought:</p>
<p>‘I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure</p>
<p>to know.’ She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then</p>
<p>she knocked at the window and cried: ‘Hans, is Elsie within?’ ‘Yes,’</p>
<p>answered Hans, ‘she is within.’ Hereupon she was terrified, and said:</p>
<p>‘Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,’ and went to another door; but when the</p>
<p>people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she</p>
<p>could get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village, and no one has</p>
<p>seen her since.</p>
