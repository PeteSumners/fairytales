            <p>There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called</p>
<p>Dummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion.</p>
<p>[*] Simpleton</p>
<p>It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood,</p>
<p>and before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a</p>
<p>bottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.</p>
<p>When he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade</p>
<p>him good day, and said: ‘Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket,</p>
<p>and let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.’ But</p>
<p>the clever son answered: ‘If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have</p>
<p>none for myself; be off with you,’ and he left the little man standing</p>
<p>and went on.</p>
<p>But when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a</p>
<p>false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home</p>
<p>and have it bound up. And this was the little grey man’s doing.</p>
<p>After this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave him,</p>
<p>like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old grey man</p>
<p>met him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine.</p>
<p>But the second son, too, said sensibly enough: ‘What I give you will be</p>
<p>taken away from myself; be off!’ and he left the little man standing and</p>
<p>went on. His punishment, however, was not delayed; when he had made a</p>
<p>few blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be</p>
<p>carried home.</p>
<p>Then Dummling said: ‘Father, do let me go and cut wood.’ The father</p>
<p>answered: ‘Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone,</p>
<p>you do not understand anything about it.’ But Dummling begged so long</p>
<p>that at last he said: ‘Just go then, you will get wiser by hurting</p>
<p>yourself.’ His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the</p>
<p>cinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer.</p>
<p>When he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise,</p>
<p>and greeting him, said: ‘Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out</p>
<p>of your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.’ Dummling answered: ‘I have</p>
<p>only cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit</p>
<p>down and eat.’ So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his</p>
<p>cinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good</p>
<p>wine. So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said: ‘Since</p>
<p>you have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will</p>
<p>give you good luck. There stands an old tree, cut it down, and you will</p>
<p>find something at the roots.’ Then the little man took leave of him.</p>
<p>Dummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose</p>
<p>sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her up, and</p>
<p>taking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the</p>
<p>night. Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were</p>
<p>curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have</p>
<p>liked to have one of its golden feathers.</p>
<p>The eldest thought: ‘I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a</p>
<p>feather,’ and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by</p>
<p>the wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.</p>
<p>The second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a</p>
<p>feather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she</p>
<p>was held fast.</p>
<p>At last the third also came with the like intent, and the others</p>
<p>screamed out: ‘Keep away; for goodness’ sake keep away!’ But she did</p>
<p>not understand why she was to keep away. ‘The others are there,’ she</p>
<p>thought, ‘I may as well be there too,’ and ran to them; but as soon as</p>
<p>she had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her. So they</p>
<p>had to spend the night with the goose.</p>
<p>The next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out,</p>
<p>without troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to</p>
<p>it. They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right,</p>
<p>wherever his legs took him.</p>
<p>In the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the</p>
<p>procession he said: ‘For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you</p>
<p>running across the fields after this young man? Is that seemly?’ At the</p>
<p>same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away,</p>
<p>but as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself</p>
<p>obliged to run behind.</p>
<p>Before long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running</p>
<p>behind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out: ‘Hi!</p>
<p>your reverence, whither away so quickly? Do not forget that we have a</p>
<p>christening today!’ and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but</p>
<p>was also held fast to it.</p>
<p>Whilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers</p>
<p>came with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them</p>
<p>and begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had</p>
<p>scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were</p>
<p>seven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter</p>
<p>who was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he had put forth</p>
<p>a decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry</p>
<p>her. When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train</p>
<p>before the king’s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people</p>
<p>running on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite</p>
<p>loudly, and as if she would never stop. Thereupon Dummling asked to have</p>
<p>her for his wife; but the king did not like the son-in-law, and made all</p>
<p>manner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink</p>
<p>a cellarful of wine. Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could</p>
<p>certainly help him; so he went into the forest, and in the same place</p>
<p>where he had felled the tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very</p>
<p>sorrowful face. Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so</p>
<p>sorely, and he answered: ‘I have such a great thirst and cannot quench</p>
<p>it; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of wine I have just emptied, but</p>
<p>that to me is like a drop on a hot stone!’</p>
<p>‘There, I can help you,’ said Dummling, ‘just come with me and you shall</p>
<p>be satisfied.’</p>
<p>He led him into the king’s cellar, and the man bent over the huge</p>
<p>barrels, and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was</p>
<p>out he had emptied all the barrels. Then Dummling asked once more</p>
<p>for his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom</p>
<p>everyone called Dummling, should take away his daughter, and he made a</p>
<p>new condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain</p>
<p>of bread. Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the</p>
<p>forest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his</p>
<p>body with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: ‘I have eaten a</p>
<p>whole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger</p>
<p>as I? My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to</p>
<p>die of hunger.’</p>
<p>At this Dummling was glad, and said: ‘Get up and come with me; you shall</p>
<p>eat yourself full.’ He led him to the king’s palace where all the</p>
<p>flour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a huge</p>
<p>mountain of bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood before it,</p>
<p>began to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished.</p>
<p>Then Dummling for the third time asked for his bride; but the king again</p>
<p>sought a way out, and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on</p>
<p>water. ‘As soon as you come sailing back in it,’ said he, ‘you shall</p>
<p>have my daughter for wife.’</p>
<p>Dummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey</p>
<p>man to whom he had given his cake. When he heard what Dummling wanted,</p>
<p>he said: ‘Since you have given me to eat and to drink, I will give you</p>
<p>the ship; and I do all this because you once were kind to me.’ Then he</p>
<p>gave him the ship which could sail on land and water, and when the king</p>
<p>saw that, he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter. The</p>
<p>wedding was celebrated, and after the king’s death, Dummling inherited</p>
<p>his kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.</p>
