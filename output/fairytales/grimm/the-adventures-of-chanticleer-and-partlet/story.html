        <div class="story-content">
            <p>1. HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS</p>
<p>‘The nuts are quite ripe now,’ said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet,</p>
<p>‘suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can,</p>
<p>before the squirrel takes them all away.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said</p>
<p>Partlet, ‘let us go and make a holiday of it together.’</p>
<p>So they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they stayed</p>
<p>there till the evening. Now, whether it was that they had eaten so many</p>
<p>nuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and would not,</p>
<p>I do not know: however, they took it into their heads that it did not</p>
<p>become them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to build a little</p>
<p>carriage of nutshells: and when it was finished, Partlet jumped into</p>
<p>it and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her</p>
<p>home. ‘That’s a good joke!’ said Chanticleer; ‘no, that will never do;</p>
<p>I had rather by half walk home; I’ll sit on the box and be coachman,</p>
<p>if you like, but I’ll not draw.’ While this was passing, a duck came</p>
<p>quacking up and cried out, ‘You thieving vagabonds, what business have</p>
<p>you in my grounds? I’ll give it you well for your insolence!’ and upon</p>
<p>that she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily. But Chanticleer was no</p>
<p>coward, and returned the duck’s blows with his sharp spurs so fiercely</p>
<p>that she soon began to cry out for mercy; which was only granted her</p>
<p>upon condition that she would draw the carriage home for them. This she</p>
<p>agreed to do; and Chanticleer got upon the box, and drove, crying, ‘Now,</p>
<p>duck, get on as fast as you can.’ And away they went at a pretty good</p>
<p>pace.</p>
<p>After they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin</p>
<p>walking together along the road: and the needle cried out, ‘Stop, stop!’</p>
<p>and said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such</p>
<p>dirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his</p>
<p>friend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat</p>
<p>drinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore</p>
<p>that the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their</p>
<p>carriage. Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows, and not</p>
<p>likely to take up much room, told them they might ride, but made them</p>
<p>promise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in, nor to</p>
<p>tread on Partlet’s toes.</p>
<p>Late at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in</p>
<p>the dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good</p>
<p>deal from one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their</p>
<p>quarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his</p>
<p>house was full, thinking they might not be very respectable company:</p>
<p>however, they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet</p>
<p>had laid by the way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in</p>
<p>the habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in, and</p>
<p>they bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was</p>
<p>stirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the</p>
<p>egg, they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into the</p>
<p>fireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast asleep,</p>
<p>and seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord’s easy chair</p>
<p>and the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this, they crept</p>
<p>away as softly as possible. However, the duck, who slept in the open</p>
<p>air in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran</p>
<p>close by the inn, soon swam out of their reach.</p>
<p>An hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his handkerchief</p>
<p>to wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked him: then he</p>
<p>walked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire, but when he</p>
<p>stirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost blinded him.</p>
<p>‘Bless me!’ said he, ‘all the world seems to have a design against my</p>
<p>head this morning’: and so saying, he threw himself sulkily into his</p>
<p>easy chair; but, oh dear! the needle ran into him; and this time the</p>
<p>pain was not in his head. He now flew into a very great passion, and,</p>
<p>suspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look</p>
<p>after them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again</p>
<p>would take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no</p>
<p>reckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.</p>
<p>2. HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VISIT MR KORBES</p>
<p>Another day, Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together;</p>
<p>so Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and</p>
<p>harnessed six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the carriage,</p>
<p>and away they drove. Soon afterwards a cat met them, and said, ‘Where</p>
<p>are you going?’ And Chanticleer replied,</p>
<p>‘All on our way</p>
<p>A visit to pay</p>
<p>To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’</p>
<p>Then the cat said, ‘Take me with you,’ Chanticleer said, ‘With all my</p>
<p>heart: get up behind, and be sure you do not fall off.’</p>
<p>‘Take care of this handsome coach of mine,</p>
<p>Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine!</p>
<p>Now, mice, be ready,</p>
<p>And, wheels, run steady!</p>
<p>For we are going a visit to pay</p>
<p>To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’</p>
<p>Soon after came up a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin; and</p>
<p>Chanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>When they arrived at Mr Korbes’s house, he was not at home; so the mice</p>
<p>drew the carriage into the coach-house, Chanticleer and Partlet flew</p>
<p>upon a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck got into</p>
<p>the washing cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow, the</p>
<p>millstone laid himself over the house door, and the egg rolled himself</p>
<p>up in the towel.</p>
<p>When Mr Korbes came home, he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but</p>
<p>the cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to</p>
<p>wash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face; and</p>
<p>when he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces in the towel all</p>
<p>over his face and eyes. Then he was very angry, and went without his</p>
<p>supper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into</p>
<p>his cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have</p>
<p>run out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell</p>
<p>down on his head, and killed him on the spot.</p>
<p>3. HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF</p>
<p>Another day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountains</p>
<p>to eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found</p>
<p>should be shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a very large</p>
<p>nut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it all to</p>
<p>herself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it</p>
<p>stuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to</p>
<p>Chanticleer, ‘Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I</p>
<p>shall be choked.’ Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river, and</p>
<p>said, ‘River, give me some water, for Partlet lies in the mountain, and</p>
<p>will be choked by a great nut.’ The river said, ‘Run first to the bride,</p>
<p>and ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water.’ Chanticleer ran to</p>
<p>the bride, and said, ‘Bride, you must give me a silken cord, for then</p>
<p>the river will give me water, and the water I will carry to Partlet, who</p>
<p>lies on the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.’ But the bride</p>
<p>said, ‘Run first, and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow</p>
<p>in the garden.’ Then Chanticleer ran to the garden, and took the garland</p>
<p>from the bough where it hung, and brought it to the bride; and then</p>
<p>the bride gave him the silken cord, and he took the silken cord to</p>
<p>the river, and the river gave him water, and he carried the water to</p>
<p>Partlet; but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut, and lay</p>
<p>quite dead, and never moved any more.</p>
<p>Then Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts</p>
<p>came and wept with him over poor Partlet. And six mice built a little</p>
<p>hearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed</p>
<p>themselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them. On the way they</p>
<p>met the fox. ‘Where are you going, Chanticleer?’ said he. ‘To bury my</p>
<p>Partlet,’ said the other. ‘May I go with you?’ said the fox. ‘Yes; but</p>
<p>you must get up behind, or my horses will not be able to draw you.’ Then</p>
<p>the fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the bear, the goat, and</p>
<p>all the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon the hearse.</p>
<p>So on they went till they came to a rapid stream. ‘How shall we get</p>
<p>over?’ said Chanticleer. Then said a straw, ‘I will lay myself across,</p>
<p>and you may pass over upon me.’ But as the mice were going over, the</p>
<p>straw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in</p>
<p>and were drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood came</p>
<p>and said, ‘I am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream, and you</p>
<p>shall pass over upon me.’ So he laid himself down; but they managed</p>
<p>so clumsily, that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the</p>
<p>stream. Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly</p>
<p>offered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream;</p>
<p>and this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse, and</p>
<p>managed to get Partlet out of it; but the fox and the other mourners,</p>
<p>who were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into the water</p>
<p>and were all carried away by the stream and drowned.</p>
<p>Thus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having dug</p>
<p>a grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over her.</p>
<p>Then he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he</p>
<p>died too; and so all were dead.</p>
