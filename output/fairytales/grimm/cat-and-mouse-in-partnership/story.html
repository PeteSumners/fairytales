        <div class="story-content">
            <p>A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much</p>
<p>to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at</p>
<p>length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.</p>
<p>‘But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer</p>
<p>from hunger,’ said the cat; ‘and you, little mouse, cannot venture</p>
<p>everywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.’ The good advice</p>
<p>was followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where</p>
<p>to put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: ‘I know no</p>
<p>place where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one</p>
<p>dares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar,</p>
<p>and not touch it until we are really in need of it.’ So the pot was</p>
<p>placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great</p>
<p>yearning for it, and said to the mouse: ‘I want to tell you something,</p>
<p>little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has</p>
<p>asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold</p>
<p>him over the font at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look</p>
<p>after the house by yourself.’ ‘Yes, yes,’ answered the mouse, ‘by all</p>
<p>means go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me. I</p>
<p>should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.’ All this,</p>
<p>however, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to</p>
<p>be godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat,</p>
<p>began to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a</p>
<p>walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then</p>
<p>stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought</p>
<p>of the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home.</p>
<p>‘Well, here you are again,’ said the mouse, ‘no doubt you have had a</p>
<p>merry day.’ ‘All went off well,’ answered the cat. ‘What name did they</p>
<p>give the child?’ ‘Top off!’ said the cat quite coolly. ‘Top off!’ cried</p>
<p>the mouse, ‘that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in</p>
<p>your family?’ ‘What does that matter,’ said the cat, ‘it is no worse</p>
<p>than Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.’</p>
<p>Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to</p>
<p>the mouse: ‘You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for</p>
<p>a day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a</p>
<p>white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.’ The good mouse consented,</p>
<p>but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured</p>
<p>half the pot of fat. ‘Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to</p>
<p>oneself,’ said she, and was quite satisfied with her day’s work. When</p>
<p>she went home the mouse inquired: ‘And what was the child christened?’</p>
<p>‘Half-done,’ answered the cat. ‘Half-done! What are you saying? I</p>
<p>never heard the name in my life, I’ll wager anything it is not in the</p>
<p>calendar!’</p>
<p>The cat’s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. ‘All good</p>
<p>things go in threes,’ said she, ‘I am asked to stand godmother again.</p>
<p>The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that</p>
<p>exception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only</p>
<p>happens once every few years, you will let me go, won’t you?’ ‘Top-off!</p>
<p>Half-done!’ answered the mouse, ‘they are such odd names, they make me</p>
<p>very thoughtful.’ ‘You sit at home,’ said the cat, ‘in your dark-grey</p>
<p>fur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that’s because</p>
<p>you do not go out in the daytime.’ During the cat’s absence the mouse</p>
<p>cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely</p>
<p>emptied the pot of fat. ‘When everything is eaten up one has some</p>
<p>peace,’ said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return</p>
<p>home till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to</p>
<p>the third child. ‘It will not please you more than the others,’ said the</p>
<p>cat. ‘He is called All-gone.’ ‘All-gone,’ cried the mouse ‘that is the</p>
<p>most suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print. All-gone;</p>
<p>what can that mean?’ and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay</p>
<p>down to sleep.</p>
<p>From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but</p>
<p>when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found</p>
<p>outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: ‘Come, cat,</p>
<p>we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we</p>
<p>shall enjoy that.’ ‘Yes,’ answered the cat, ‘you will enjoy it as much</p>
<p>as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the</p>
<p>window.’ They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of</p>
<p>fat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. ‘Alas!’ said the</p>
<p>mouse, ‘now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true</p>
<p>friend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First</p>
<p>top off, then half-done, then--’ ‘Will you hold your tongue,’ cried the</p>
<p>cat, ‘one word more, and I will eat you too.’ ‘All-gone’ was already on</p>
<p>the poor mouse’s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang</p>
<p>on her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of</p>
<p>the world.</p>
