        <div class="story-content">
            <p>There was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children.</p>
<p>Every morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to</p>
<p>bestow on her a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to her</p>
<p>and said: ‘Be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of wishing,</p>
<p>so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have.’ Then</p>
<p>she went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time</p>
<p>was come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness.</p>
<p>Every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild</p>
<p>beasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. It</p>
<p>happened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in</p>
<p>her arms and she fell asleep. Then came the old cook, who knew that the</p>
<p>child had the power of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a hen,</p>
<p>and cut it in pieces, and dropped some of its blood on the queen’s apron</p>
<p>and on her dress. Then he carried the child away to a secret place,</p>
<p>where a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and</p>
<p>accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by</p>
<p>the wild beasts. When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed</p>
<p>this, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built,</p>
<p>in which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into</p>
<p>it, and walled up. Here she was to stay for seven years without meat</p>
<p>or drink, and die of hunger. But God sent two angels from heaven in the</p>
<p>shape of white doves, which flew to her twice a day, and carried her</p>
<p>food until the seven years were over.</p>
<p>The cook, however, thought to himself: ‘If the child has the power of</p>
<p>wishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.’ So</p>
<p>he left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to</p>
<p>speak, and said to him: ‘Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with</p>
<p>a garden, and all else that pertains to it.’ Scarcely were the words out</p>
<p>of the boy’s mouth, when everything was there that he had wished for.</p>
<p>After a while the cook said to him: ‘It is not well for you to be so</p>
<p>alone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion.’ Then the king’s son</p>
<p>wished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was more</p>
<p>beautiful than any painter could have painted her. The two played</p>
<p>together, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook</p>
<p>went out hunting like a nobleman. The thought occurred to him, however,</p>
<p>that the king’s son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus</p>
<p>bring him into great peril. So he went out and took the maiden aside,</p>
<p>and said: ‘Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this</p>
<p>knife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do</p>
<p>not do it, you shall lose your life.’ Thereupon he went away, and when</p>
<p>he returned next day she had not done it, and said: ‘Why should I shed</p>
<p>the blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed anyone?’ The cook once</p>
<p>more said: ‘If you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life.’ When</p>
<p>he had gone away, she had a little hind brought to her, and ordered her</p>
<p>to be killed, and took her heart and tongue, and laid them on a plate,</p>
<p>and when she saw the old man coming, she said to the boy: ‘Lie down in</p>
<p>your bed, and draw the clothes over you.’ Then the wicked wretch came in</p>
<p>and said: ‘Where are the boy’s heart and tongue?’ The girl reached the</p>
<p>plate to him, but the king’s son threw off the quilt, and said: ‘You old</p>
<p>sinner, why did you want to kill me? Now will I pronounce thy sentence.</p>
<p>You shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck,</p>
<p>and shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your</p>
<p>throat.’ And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed</p>
<p>into a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks</p>
<p>were ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the</p>
<p>flames broke forth from his throat. The king’s son remained there a</p>
<p>short while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she</p>
<p>were still alive. At length he said to the maiden: ‘I will go home to my</p>
<p>own country; if you will go with me, I will provide for you.’ ‘Ah,’</p>
<p>she replied, ‘the way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange land</p>
<p>where I am unknown?’ As she did not seem quite willing, and as they</p>
<p>could not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be changed</p>
<p>into a beautiful pink, and took her with him. Then he went away to his</p>
<p>own country, and the poodle had to run after him. He went to the tower</p>
<p>in which his mother was confined, and as it was so high, he wished for</p>
<p>a ladder which would reach up to the very top. Then he mounted up and</p>
<p>looked inside, and cried: ‘Beloved mother, Lady Queen, are you still</p>
<p>alive, or are you dead?’ She answered: ‘I have just eaten, and am still</p>
<p>satisfied,’ for she thought the angels were there. Said he: ‘I am your</p>
<p>dear son, whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your arms;</p>
<p>but I am alive still, and will soon set you free.’ Then he descended</p>
<p>again, and went to his father, and caused himself to be announced as a</p>
<p>strange huntsman, and asked if he could offer him service. The king said</p>
<p>yes, if he was skilful and could get game for him, he should come to</p>
<p>him, but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of the</p>
<p>district or country. Then the huntsman promised to procure as much game</p>
<p>for him as he could possibly use at the royal table. So he summoned all</p>
<p>the huntsmen together, and bade them go out into the forest with him.</p>
<p>And he went with them and made them form a great circle, open at one end</p>
<p>where he stationed himself, and began to wish. Two hundred deer and more</p>
<p>came running inside the circle at once, and the huntsmen shot them.</p>
<p>Then they were all placed on sixty country carts, and driven home to the</p>
<p>king, and for once he was able to deck his table with game, after having</p>
<p>had none at all for years.</p>
<p>Now the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire</p>
<p>household should eat with him next day, and made a great feast. When</p>
<p>they were all assembled together, he said to the huntsman: ‘As you are</p>
<p>so clever, you shall sit by me.’ He replied: ‘Lord King, your majesty</p>
<p>must excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.’ But the king insisted on it,</p>
<p>and said: ‘You shall sit by me,’ until he did it. Whilst he was sitting</p>
<p>there, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the</p>
<p>king’s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how</p>
<p>it was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still,</p>
<p>or had perished. Hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal began,</p>
<p>and said: ‘Your majesty, we live joyously here, but how is the queen</p>
<p>living in the tower? Is she still alive, or has she died?’ But the king</p>
<p>replied: ‘She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will</p>
<p>not have her named.’ Then the huntsman arose and said: ‘Gracious lord</p>
<p>father she is alive still, and I am her son, and I was not carried away</p>
<p>by wild beasts, but by that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her</p>
<p>arms when she was asleep, and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a</p>
<p>chicken.’ Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar, and said:</p>
<p>‘That is the wretch!’ and caused live coals to be brought, and these the</p>
<p>dog was compelled to devour before the sight of all, until flames burst</p>
<p>forth from its throat. On this the huntsman asked the king if he would</p>
<p>like to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into the form</p>
<p>of the cook, in which he stood immediately, with his white apron,</p>
<p>and his knife by his side. When the king saw him he fell into a passion,</p>
<p>and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon. Then the huntsman</p>
<p>spoke further and said: ‘Father, will you see the maiden who brought me</p>
<p>up so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me, but did not do it,</p>
<p>though her own life depended on it?’ The king replied: ‘Yes, I would</p>
<p>like to see her.’ The son said: ‘Most gracious father, I will show her</p>
<p>to you in the form of a beautiful flower,’ and he thrust his hand into</p>
<p>his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table,</p>
<p>and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.</p>
<p>Then the son said: ‘Now will I show her to you in her own form,’ and</p>
<p>wished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there looking so</p>
<p>beautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.</p>
<p>And the king sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the tower,</p>
<p>to fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. But when she was</p>
<p>led in she ate nothing, and said: ‘The gracious and merciful God who has</p>
<p>supported me in the tower, will soon set me free.’ She lived three days</p>
<p>more, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white</p>
<p>doves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of</p>
<p>heaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. The aged</p>
<p>king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the</p>
<p>king’s own heart, and he soon died. His son married the beautiful maiden</p>
<p>whom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket, and whether they</p>
<p>are still alive or not, is known to God.</p>
