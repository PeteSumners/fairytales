        <div class="story-content">
            <p>Long before you or I were born, there reigned, in a country a great way</p>
<p>off, a king who had three sons. This king once fell very ill--so ill</p>
<p>that nobody thought he could live. His sons were very much grieved</p>
<p>at their father’s sickness; and as they were walking together very</p>
<p>mournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and</p>
<p>asked what was the matter. They told him that their father was very ill,</p>
<p>and that they were afraid nothing could save him. ‘I know what would,’</p>
<p>said the little old man; ‘it is the Water of Life. If he could have a</p>
<p>draught of it he would be well again; but it is very hard to get.’ Then</p>
<p>the eldest son said, ‘I will soon find it’: and he went to the sick</p>
<p>king, and begged that he might go in search of the Water of Life, as</p>
<p>it was the only thing that could save him. ‘No,’ said the king. ‘I had</p>
<p>rather die than place you in such great danger as you must meet with in</p>
<p>your journey.’ But he begged so hard that the king let him go; and the</p>
<p>prince thought to himself, ‘If I bring my father this water, he will</p>
<p>make me sole heir to his kingdom.’</p>
<p>Then he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to a</p>
<p>deep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around, he</p>
<p>saw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf, with a</p>
<p>sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him and said,</p>
<p>‘Prince, whither so fast?’ ‘What is that to thee, you ugly imp?’ said</p>
<p>the prince haughtily, and rode on.</p>
<p>But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell</p>
<p>of ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became</p>
<p>narrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he</p>
<p>could not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his</p>
<p>horse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing</p>
<p>round him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was</p>
<p>shut in all round. He next tried to get off his horse and make his way</p>
<p>on foot, but again the laugh rang in his ears, and he found himself</p>
<p>unable to move a step, and thus he was forced to abide spellbound.</p>
<p>Meantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his son’s</p>
<p>return, till at last the second son said, ‘Father, I will go in search</p>
<p>of the Water of Life.’ For he thought to himself, ‘My brother is surely</p>
<p>dead, and the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water.’ The king was</p>
<p>at first very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his wish.</p>
<p>So he set out and followed the same road which his brother had done,</p>
<p>and met with the same elf, who stopped him at the same spot in the</p>
<p>mountains, saying, as before, ‘Prince, prince, whither so fast?’ ‘Mind</p>
<p>your own affairs, busybody!’ said the prince scornfully, and rode on.</p>
<p>But the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder</p>
<p>brother, and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the</p>
<p>heart of the mountains. Thus it is with proud silly people, who think</p>
<p>themselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take advice.</p>
<p>When the second prince had thus been gone a long time, the youngest son</p>
<p>said he would go and search for the Water of Life, and trusted he should</p>
<p>soon be able to make his father well again. So he set out, and the dwarf</p>
<p>met him too at the same spot in the valley, among the mountains, and</p>
<p>said, ‘Prince, whither so fast?’ And the prince said, ‘I am going in</p>
<p>search of the Water of Life, because my father is ill, and like to die:</p>
<p>can you help me? Pray be kind, and aid me if you can!’ ‘Do you know</p>
<p>where it is to be found?’ asked the dwarf. ‘No,’ said the prince, ‘I do</p>
<p>not. Pray tell me if you know.’ ‘Then as you have spoken to me kindly,</p>
<p>and are wise enough to seek for advice, I will tell you how and where to</p>
<p>go. The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and,</p>
<p>that you may be able to reach it in safety, I will give you an iron wand</p>
<p>and two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three</p>
<p>times with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying</p>
<p>down inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they</p>
<p>will let you pass; then hasten on to the well, and take some of the</p>
<p>Water of Life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer</p>
<p>the door will shut upon you for ever.’</p>
<p>Then the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for his</p>
<p>friendly aid, and took the wand and the bread, and went travelling on</p>
<p>and on, over sea and over land, till he came to his journey’s end, and</p>
<p>found everything to be as the dwarf had told him. The door flew open at</p>
<p>the third stroke of the wand, and when the lions were quieted he went on</p>
<p>through the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall. Around it he</p>
<p>saw several knights sitting in a trance; then he pulled off their rings</p>
<p>and put them on his own fingers. In another room he saw on a table a</p>
<p>sword and a loaf of bread, which he also took. Further on he came to a</p>
<p>room where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch; and she welcomed him</p>
<p>joyfully, and said, if he would set her free from the spell that bound</p>
<p>her, the kingdom should be his, if he would come back in a year and</p>
<p>marry her. Then she told him that the well that held the Water of Life</p>
<p>was in the palace gardens; and bade him make haste, and draw what he</p>
<p>wanted before the clock struck twelve.</p>
<p>He walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a</p>
<p>delightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he thought to himself,</p>
<p>as he felt tired, that he would rest himself for a while, and gaze on</p>
<p>the lovely scenes around him. So he laid himself down, and sleep</p>
<p>fell upon him unawares, so that he did not wake up till the clock was</p>
<p>striking a quarter to twelve. Then he sprang from the couch dreadfully</p>
<p>frightened, ran to the well, filled a cup that was standing by him full</p>
<p>of water, and hastened to get away in time. Just as he was going out of</p>
<p>the iron door it struck twelve, and the door fell so quickly upon him</p>
<p>that it snapped off a piece of his heel.</p>
<p>When he found himself safe, he was overjoyed to think that he had got</p>
<p>the Water of Life; and as he was going on his way homewards, he passed</p>
<p>by the little dwarf, who, when he saw the sword and the loaf, said, ‘You</p>
<p>have made a noble prize; with the sword you can at a blow slay whole</p>
<p>armies, and the bread will never fail you.’ Then the prince thought</p>
<p>to himself, ‘I cannot go home to my father without my brothers’; so he</p>
<p>said, ‘My dear friend, cannot you tell me where my two brothers are, who</p>
<p>set out in search of the Water of Life before me, and never came back?’</p>
<p>‘I have shut them up by a charm between two mountains,’ said the dwarf,</p>
<p>‘because they were proud and ill-behaved, and scorned to ask advice.’</p>
<p>The prince begged so hard for his brothers, that the dwarf at last set</p>
<p>them free, though unwillingly, saying, ‘Beware of them, for they have</p>
<p>bad hearts.’ Their brother, however, was greatly rejoiced to see them,</p>
<p>and told them all that had happened to him; how he had found the Water</p>
<p>of Life, and had taken a cup full of it; and how he had set a beautiful</p>
<p>princess free from a spell that bound her; and how she had engaged to</p>
<p>wait a whole year, and then to marry him, and to give him the kingdom.</p>
<p>Then they all three rode on together, and on their way home came to a</p>
<p>country that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine, so that it was</p>
<p>feared all must die for want. But the prince gave the king of the land</p>
<p>the bread, and all his kingdom ate of it. And he lent the king the</p>
<p>wonderful sword, and he slew the enemy’s army with it; and thus the</p>
<p>kingdom was once more in peace and plenty. In the same manner he</p>
<p>befriended two other countries through which they passed on their way.</p>
<p>When they came to the sea, they got into a ship and during their voyage</p>
<p>the two eldest said to themselves, ‘Our brother has got the water which</p>
<p>we could not find, therefore our father will forsake us and give him the</p>
<p>kingdom, which is our right’; so they were full of envy and revenge, and</p>
<p>agreed together how they could ruin him. Then they waited till he was</p>
<p>fast asleep, and poured the Water of Life out of the cup, and took it</p>
<p>for themselves, giving him bitter sea-water instead.</p>
<p>When they came to their journey’s end, the youngest son brought his cup</p>
<p>to the sick king, that he might drink and be healed. Scarcely, however,</p>
<p>had he tasted the bitter sea-water when he became worse even than he was</p>
<p>before; and then both the elder sons came in, and blamed the youngest</p>
<p>for what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison their father,</p>
<p>but that they had found the Water of Life, and had brought it with them.</p>
<p>He no sooner began to drink of what they brought him, than he felt his</p>
<p>sickness leave him, and was as strong and well as in his younger days.</p>
<p>Then they went to their brother, and laughed at him, and said, ‘Well,</p>
<p>brother, you found the Water of Life, did you? You have had the trouble</p>
<p>and we shall have the reward. Pray, with all your cleverness, why did</p>
<p>not you manage to keep your eyes open? Next year one of us will take</p>
<p>away your beautiful princess, if you do not take care. You had better</p>
<p>say nothing about this to our father, for he does not believe a word you</p>
<p>say; and if you tell tales, you shall lose your life into the bargain:</p>
<p>but be quiet, and we will let you off.’</p>
<p>The old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and thought</p>
<p>that he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his court</p>
<p>together, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that he ought to</p>
<p>be put to death. The prince knew nothing of what was going on, till one</p>
<p>day, when the king’s chief huntsmen went a-hunting with him, and they</p>
<p>were alone in the wood together, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that</p>
<p>the prince said, ‘My friend, what is the matter with you?’ ‘I cannot and</p>
<p>dare not tell you,’ said he. But the prince begged very hard, and said,</p>
<p>‘Only tell me what it is, and do not think I shall be angry, for I will</p>
<p>forgive you.’ ‘Alas!’ said the huntsman; ‘the king has ordered me to</p>
<p>shoot you.’ The prince started at this, and said, ‘Let me live, and I</p>
<p>will change dresses with you; you shall take my royal coat to show to my</p>
<p>father, and do you give me your shabby one.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said</p>
<p>the huntsman; ‘I am sure I shall be glad to save you, for I could not</p>
<p>have shot you.’ Then he took the prince’s coat, and gave him the shabby</p>
<p>one, and went away through the wood.</p>
<p>Some time after, three grand embassies came to the old king’s court,</p>
<p>with rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest son; now</p>
<p>all these were sent from the three kings to whom he had lent his sword</p>
<p>and loaf of bread, in order to rid them of their enemy and feed their</p>
<p>people. This touched the old king’s heart, and he thought his son might</p>
<p>still be guiltless, and said to his court, ‘O that my son were still</p>
<p>alive! how it grieves me that I had him killed!’ ‘He is still alive,’</p>
<p>said the huntsman; ‘and I am glad that I had pity on him, but let him</p>
<p>go in peace, and brought home his royal coat.’ At this the king was</p>
<p>overwhelmed with joy, and made it known throughout all his kingdom, that</p>
<p>if his son would come back to his court he would forgive him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should</p>
<p>come back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining</p>
<p>gold; and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback, and rode</p>
<p>straight up to the gate upon it, was her true lover; and that they must</p>
<p>let him in: but whoever rode on one side of it, they must be sure was</p>
<p>not the right one; and that they must send him away at once.</p>
<p>The time soon came, when the eldest brother thought that he would make</p>
<p>haste to go to the princess, and say that he was the one who had set</p>
<p>her free, and that he should have her for his wife, and the kingdom with</p>
<p>her. As he came before the palace and saw the golden road, he stopped to</p>
<p>look at it, and he thought to himself, ‘It is a pity to ride upon this</p>
<p>beautiful road’; so he turned aside and rode on the right-hand side of</p>
<p>it. But when he came to the gate, the guards, who had seen the road</p>
<p>he took, said to him, he could not be what he said he was, and must go</p>
<p>about his business.</p>
<p>The second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and when</p>
<p>he came to the golden road, and his horse had set one foot upon it,</p>
<p>he stopped to look at it, and thought it very beautiful, and said to</p>
<p>himself, ‘What a pity it is that anything should tread here!’ Then he</p>
<p>too turned aside and rode on the left side of it. But when he came to</p>
<p>the gate the guards said he was not the true prince, and that he too</p>
<p>must go away about his business; and away he went.</p>
<p>Now when the full year was come round, the third brother left the forest</p>
<p>in which he had lain hid for fear of his father’s anger, and set out in</p>
<p>search of his betrothed bride. So he journeyed on, thinking of her all</p>
<p>the way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was</p>
<p>made of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the</p>
<p>gate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with joy, and said</p>
<p>he was her deliverer, and should now be her husband and lord of the</p>
<p>kingdom. When the first joy at their meeting was over, the princess told</p>
<p>him she had heard of his father having forgiven him, and of his wish to</p>
<p>have him home again: so, before his wedding with the princess, he went</p>
<p>to visit his father, taking her with him. Then he told him everything;</p>
<p>how his brothers had cheated and robbed him, and yet that he had borne</p>
<p>all those wrongs for the love of his father. And the old king was very</p>
<p>angry, and wanted to punish his wicked sons; but they made their escape,</p>
<p>and got into a ship and sailed away over the wide sea, and where they</p>
<p>went to nobody knew and nobody cared.</p>
<p>And now the old king gathered together his court, and asked all his</p>
<p>kingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess.</p>
<p>And young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once</p>
<p>on the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the</p>
<p>sugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak.</p>
<p>And the wedding was held, and the merry bells run.</p>
<p>And all the good people they danced and they sung,</p>
<p>And feasted and frolick’d I can’t tell how long.</p>
