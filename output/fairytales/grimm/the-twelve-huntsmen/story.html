            <p>There was once a king’s son who had a bride whom he loved very much. And</p>
<p>when he was sitting beside her and very happy, news came that his father</p>
<p>lay sick unto death, and desired to see him once again before his end.</p>
<p>Then he said to his beloved: ‘I must now go and leave you, I give you</p>
<p>a ring as a remembrance of me. When I am king, I will return and fetch</p>
<p>you.’ So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was</p>
<p>dangerously ill, and near his death. He said to him: ‘Dear son, I wished</p>
<p>to see you once again before my end, promise me to marry as I wish,’ and</p>
<p>he named a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife. The son was</p>
<p>in such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said: ‘Yes,</p>
<p>dear father, your will shall be done,’ and thereupon the king shut his</p>
<p>eyes, and died.</p>
<p>When therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of</p>
<p>mourning was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had given</p>
<p>his father, and caused the king’s daughter to be asked in marriage, and</p>
<p>she was promised to him. His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted</p>
<p>so much about his faithfulness that she nearly died. Then her father</p>
<p>said to her: ‘Dearest child, why are you so sad? You shall have</p>
<p>whatsoever you will.’ She thought for a moment and said: ‘Dear father,</p>
<p>I wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face, figure, and size.’</p>
<p>The father said: ‘If it be possible, your desire shall be fulfilled,’</p>
<p>and he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom, until eleven</p>
<p>young maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in face,</p>
<p>figure, and size.</p>
<p>When they came to the king’s daughter, she had twelve suits of</p>
<p>huntsmen’s clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to put</p>
<p>on the huntsmen’s clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit.</p>
<p>Thereupon she took her leave of her father, and rode away with them,</p>
<p>and rode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly.</p>
<p>Then she asked if he required any huntsmen, and if he would take all of</p>
<p>them into his service. The king looked at her and did not know her, but</p>
<p>as they were such handsome fellows, he said: ‘Yes,’ and that he would</p>
<p>willingly take them, and now they were the king’s twelve huntsmen.</p>
<p>The king, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew</p>
<p>all concealed and secret things. It came to pass that one evening he</p>
<p>said to the king: ‘You think you have twelve huntsmen?’ ‘Yes,’ said the</p>
<p>king, ‘they are twelve huntsmen.’ The lion continued: ‘You are mistaken,</p>
<p>they are twelve girls.’ The king said: ‘That cannot be true! How</p>
<p>will you prove that to me?’ ‘Oh, just let some peas be strewn in the</p>
<p>ante-chamber,’ answered the lion, ‘and then you will soon see. Men have</p>
<p>a firm step, and when they walk over peas none of them stir, but girls</p>
<p>trip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about.’ The king</p>
<p>was well pleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn.</p>
<p>There was, however, a servant of the king’s who favoured the huntsmen,</p>
<p>and when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went to</p>
<p>them and repeated everything, and said: ‘The lion wants to make the king</p>
<p>believe that you are girls.’ Then the king’s daughter thanked him, and</p>
<p>said to her maidens: ‘Show some strength, and step firmly on the peas.’</p>
<p>So next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called before</p>
<p>him, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they</p>
<p>stepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not</p>
<p>one of the peas either rolled or stirred. Then they went away again,</p>
<p>and the king said to the lion: ‘You have lied to me, they walk just like</p>
<p>men.’ The lion said: ‘They have been informed that they were going to</p>
<p>be put to the test, and have assumed some strength. Just let twelve</p>
<p>spinning-wheels be brought into the ante-chamber, and they will go to</p>
<p>them and be pleased with them, and that is what no man would do.’</p>
<p>The king liked the advice, and had the spinning-wheels placed in the</p>
<p>ante-chamber.</p>
<p>But the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them,</p>
<p>and disclosed the project. So when they were alone the king’s daughter</p>
<p>said to her eleven girls: ‘Show some constraint, and do not look round</p>
<p>at the spinning-wheels.’ And next morning when the king had his twelve</p>
<p>huntsmen summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once</p>
<p>looked at the spinning-wheels. Then the king again said to the lion:</p>
<p>‘You have deceived me, they are men, for they have not looked at the</p>
<p>spinning-wheels.’ The lion replied: ‘They have restrained themselves.’</p>
<p>The king, however, would no longer believe the lion.</p>
<p>The twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase, and his</p>
<p>liking for them continually increased. Now it came to pass that</p>
<p>once when they were out hunting, news came that the king’s bride was</p>
<p>approaching. When the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much that</p>
<p>her heart was almost broken, and she fell fainting to the ground. The</p>
<p>king thought something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him,</p>
<p>wanted to help him, and drew his glove off. Then he saw the ring which</p>
<p>he had given to his first bride, and when he looked in her face he</p>
<p>recognized her. Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and</p>
<p>when she opened her eyes he said: ‘You are mine, and I am yours, and</p>
<p>no one in the world can alter that.’ He sent a messenger to the other</p>
<p>bride, and entreated her to return to her own kingdom, for he had a wife</p>
<p>already, and someone who had just found an old key did not require a new</p>
<p>one. Thereupon the wedding was celebrated, and the lion was again taken</p>
<p>into favour, because, after all, he had told the truth.</p>
