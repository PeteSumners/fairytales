        <div class="story-content">
            <p>A farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to</p>
<p>him: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him</p>
<p>nothing more to eat, and said, ‘I want you no longer, so take yourself</p>
<p>off out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are</p>
<p>stronger than a lion.’ Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.</p>
<p>The poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the</p>
<p>wood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently</p>
<p>a fox met him: ‘What’s the matter, my friend?’ said he, ‘why do you hang</p>
<p>down your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?’ ‘Ah!’ replied the</p>
<p>horse, ‘justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has</p>
<p>forgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I</p>
<p>can no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become</p>
<p>stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I</p>
<p>have of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so.’</p>
<p>However, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, ‘I will help you;</p>
<p>lie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be</p>
<p>dead.’ The horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the</p>
<p>lion who lived in a cave close by, and said to him, ‘A little way off</p>
<p>lies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent meal of</p>
<p>his carcase.’ The lion was greatly pleased, and set off immediately; and</p>
<p>when they came to the horse, the fox said, ‘You will not be able to eat</p>
<p>him comfortably here; I’ll tell you what--I will tie you fast to</p>
<p>his tail, and then you can draw him to your den, and eat him at your</p>
<p>leisure.’</p>
<p>This advice pleased the lion, so he laid himself down quietly for the</p>
<p>fox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs</p>
<p>together and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he</p>
<p>could not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped the</p>
<p>horse on the shoulder, and said, ‘Jip! Dobbin! Jip!’ Then up he sprang,</p>
<p>and moved off, dragging the lion behind him. The beast began to roar</p>
<p>and bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the</p>
<p>horse let him sing on, and made his way quietly over the fields to his</p>
<p>master’s house.</p>
<p>‘Here he is, master,’ said he, ‘I have got the better of him’: and when</p>
<p>the farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said. ‘Thou</p>
<p>shalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.’ And so the poor old</p>
<p>horse had plenty to eat, and lived--till he died.</p>
