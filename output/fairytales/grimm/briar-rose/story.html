            <p>A king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off,</p>
<p>where there were in those days fairies. Now this king and queen had</p>
<p>plenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of</p>
<p>good things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but</p>
<p>though they had been married many years they had no children, and this</p>
<p>grieved them very much indeed. But one day as the queen was walking</p>
<p>by the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor</p>
<p>little fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping</p>
<p>and nearly dead on the bank. Then the queen took pity on the little</p>
<p>fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away</p>
<p>it lifted its head out of the water and said, ‘I know what your wish is,</p>
<p>and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will</p>
<p>soon have a daughter.’ What the little fish had foretold soon came to</p>
<p>pass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king</p>
<p>could not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great</p>
<p>feast and make merry, and show the child to all the land. So he asked</p>
<p>his kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and neighbours. But the queen</p>
<p>said, ‘I will have the fairies also, that they might be kind and good</p>
<p>to our little daughter.’ Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom;</p>
<p>but as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat</p>
<p>out of, they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her.</p>
<p>So twelve fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, and red</p>
<p>shoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand:</p>
<p>and after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all</p>
<p>their best gifts to the little princess. One gave her goodness, another</p>
<p>beauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>Just as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in</p>
<p>the courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was</p>
<p>come, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a</p>
<p>broomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-hall.</p>
<p>Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and</p>
<p>scolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her</p>
<p>revenge. So she cried out, ‘The king’s daughter shall, in her fifteenth</p>
<p>year, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.’ Then the twelfth of</p>
<p>the friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and</p>
<p>said that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its</p>
<p>mischief; so her gift was, that the king’s daughter, when the spindle</p>
<p>wounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a</p>
<p>hundred years.</p>
<p>However, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from</p>
<p>the threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom</p>
<p>should be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven</p>
<p>fairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so</p>
<p>beautiful, and well behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who knew</p>
<p>her loved her.</p>
<p>It happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the king</p>
<p>and queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she</p>
<p>roved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till</p>
<p>at last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase</p>
<p>ending with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when</p>
<p>she turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning</p>
<p>away very busily. ‘Why, how now, good mother,’ said the princess; ‘what</p>
<p>are you doing there?’ ‘Spinning,’ said the old lady, and nodded her</p>
<p>head, humming a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. ‘How prettily that</p>
<p>little thing turns round!’ said the princess, and took the spindle</p>
<p>and began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched it, before the</p>
<p>fairy’s prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell</p>
<p>down lifeless on the ground.</p>
<p>However, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and</p>
<p>the king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court,</p>
<p>fell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in</p>
<p>the court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon</p>
<p>the walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to</p>
<p>sleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a</p>
<p>goose upon it for the king’s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was</p>
<p>at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box</p>
<p>on the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell</p>
<p>asleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the</p>
<p>jug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.</p>
<p>A large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every year it</p>
<p>became higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded</p>
<p>and hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But</p>
<p>there went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar</p>
<p>Rose (for so the king’s daughter was called): so that, from time to</p>
<p>time, several kings’ sons came, and tried to break through the thicket</p>
<p>into the palace. This, however, none of them could ever do; for the</p>
<p>thorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there</p>
<p>they stuck fast, and died wretchedly.</p>
<p>After many, many years there came a king’s son into that land: and an</p>
<p>old man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful</p>
<p>palace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess, called Briar Rose,</p>
<p>lay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard</p>
<p>from his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to</p>
<p>break through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and</p>
<p>died. Then the young prince said, ‘All this shall not frighten me; I</p>
<p>will go and see this Briar Rose.’ The old man tried to hinder him, but</p>
<p>he was bent upon going.</p>
<p>Now that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came</p>
<p>to the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through</p>
<p>which he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever.</p>
<p>Then he came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs</p>
<p>asleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat</p>
<p>the pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. And when he</p>
<p>came into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit</p>
<p>was standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going</p>
<p>to drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be</p>
<p>plucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as</p>
<p>if she was going to beat the boy.</p>
<p>Then he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear</p>
<p>every breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and opened</p>
<p>the door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay,</p>
<p>fast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that he</p>
<p>could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.</p>
<p>But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled</p>
<p>upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also</p>
<p>awoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder.</p>
<p>And the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the</p>
<p>pigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and</p>
<p>flew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in</p>
<p>the kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit,</p>
<p>with the goose for the king’s dinner upon it; the butler finished his</p>
<p>draught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave</p>
<p>the boy the box on his ear.</p>
<p>And then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast</p>
<p>was given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.</p>
