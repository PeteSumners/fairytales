        <div class="story-content">
            <p>There was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two</p>
<p>daughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she was</p>
<p>her own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she hated,</p>
<p>because she was her stepdaughter. The stepdaughter once had a pretty</p>
<p>apron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and</p>
<p>told her mother that she must and would have that apron. ‘Be quiet, my</p>
<p>child,’ said the old woman, ‘and you shall have it. Your stepsister has</p>
<p>long deserved death; tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut her</p>
<p>head off. Only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed, and</p>
<p>push her well to the front.’ It would have been all over with the poor</p>
<p>girl if she had not just then been standing in a corner, and heard</p>
<p>everything. All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime</p>
<p>had come, the witch’s daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the</p>
<p>far side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her gently to the</p>
<p>front, and took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall. In</p>
<p>the night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right</p>
<p>hand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside,</p>
<p>and then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own child’s</p>
<p>head off.</p>
<p>When she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart, who</p>
<p>was called Roland, and knocked at his door. When he came out, she said</p>
<p>to him: ‘Listen, dearest Roland, we must fly in all haste; my stepmother</p>
<p>wanted to kill me, but has struck her own child. When daylight comes,</p>
<p>and she sees what she has done, we shall be lost.’ ‘But,’ said Roland,</p>
<p>‘I counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape</p>
<p>if she pursues us.’ The maiden fetched the magic wand, and she took the</p>
<p>dead girl’s head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground, one in</p>
<p>front of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs. Then she</p>
<p>hurried away with her lover.</p>
<p>When the old witch got up next morning, she called her daughter, and</p>
<p>wanted to give her the apron, but she did not come. Then the witch</p>
<p>cried: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping,’ answered</p>
<p>the first drop of blood. The old woman went out, but saw no one on the</p>
<p>stairs, and cried again: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Here in the kitchen, I am</p>
<p>warming myself,’ cried the second drop of blood. She went into the</p>
<p>kitchen, but found no one. Then she cried again: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Ah,</p>
<p>here in the bed, I am sleeping,’ cried the third drop of blood. She went</p>
<p>into the room to the bed. What did she see there? Her own child,</p>
<p>whose head she had cut off, bathed in her blood. The witch fell into</p>
<p>a passion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far</p>
<p>into the world, she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her</p>
<p>sweetheart Roland. ‘That shall not help you,’ cried she, ‘even if you</p>
<p>have got a long way off, you shall still not escape me.’ She put on her</p>
<p>many-league boots, in which she covered an hour’s walk at every step,</p>
<p>and it was not long before she overtook them. The girl, however, when</p>
<p>she saw the old woman striding towards her, changed, with her magic</p>
<p>wand, her sweetheart Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck</p>
<p>swimming in the middle of it. The witch placed herself on the shore,</p>
<p>threw breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice the duck;</p>
<p>but the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to</p>
<p>go home at night as she had come. At this the girl and her sweetheart</p>
<p>Roland resumed their natural shapes again, and they walked on the whole</p>
<p>night until daybreak. Then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful</p>
<p>flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her sweetheart</p>
<p>Roland into a fiddler. It was not long before the witch came striding up</p>
<p>towards them, and said to the musician: ‘Dear musician, may I pluck that</p>
<p>beautiful flower for myself?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ he replied, ‘I will play to</p>
<p>you while you do it.’ As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was</p>
<p>just going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who the flower</p>
<p>was, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was forced</p>
<p>to dance, for it was a magical dance. The faster he played, the more</p>
<p>violent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes</p>
<p>from her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he</p>
<p>did not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.</p>
<p>As they were now set free, Roland said: ‘Now I will go to my father and</p>
<p>arrange for the wedding.’ ‘Then in the meantime I will stay here and</p>
<p>wait for you,’ said the girl, ‘and that no one may recognize me, I will</p>
<p>change myself into a red stone landmark.’ Then Roland went away, and the</p>
<p>girl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved.</p>
<p>But when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another, who so</p>
<p>fascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl remained there a</p>
<p>long time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and</p>
<p>changed herself into a flower, and thought: ‘Someone will surely come</p>
<p>this way, and trample me down.’</p>
<p>It befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and saw</p>
<p>the flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with him, and</p>
<p>laid it away in his chest. From that time forth, strange things happened</p>
<p>in the shepherd’s house. When he arose in the morning, all the work was</p>
<p>already done, the room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the</p>
<p>fire in the hearth was lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon,</p>
<p>when he came home, the table was laid, and a good dinner served. He</p>
<p>could not conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being</p>
<p>in his house, and no one could have concealed himself in it. He was</p>
<p>certainly pleased with this good attendance, but still at last he was so</p>
<p>afraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice. The wise</p>
<p>woman said: ‘There is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some</p>
<p>morning if anything is moving in the room, and if you see anything, no</p>
<p>matter what it is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will</p>
<p>be stopped.’</p>
<p>The shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day dawned,</p>
<p>he saw the chest open, and the flower come out. Swiftly he</p>
<p>sprang towards it, and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly the</p>
<p>transformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him,</p>
<p>who admitted to him that she had been the flower, and that up to this</p>
<p>time she had attended to his house-keeping. She told him her story,</p>
<p>and as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she</p>
<p>answered: ‘No,’ for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart</p>
<p>Roland, although he had deserted her. Nevertheless, she promised not to</p>
<p>go away, but to continue keeping house for the shepherd.</p>
<p>And now the time drew near when Roland’s wedding was to be celebrated,</p>
<p>and then, according to an old custom in the country, it was announced</p>
<p>that all the girls were to be present at it, and sing in honour of the</p>
<p>bridal pair. When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad</p>
<p>that she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither,</p>
<p>but the other girls came and took her. When it came to her turn to sing,</p>
<p>she stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and then she</p>
<p>could not refuse. But when she began her song, and it reached Roland’s</p>
<p>ears, he sprang up and cried: ‘I know the voice, that is the true</p>
<p>bride, I will have no other!’ Everything he had forgotten, and which had</p>
<p>vanished from his mind, had suddenly come home again to his heart. Then</p>
<p>the faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and</p>
<p>grief came to an end and joy began.</p>
