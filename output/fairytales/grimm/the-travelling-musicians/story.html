            <p>An honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him</p>
<p>a great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more</p>
<p>unfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and</p>
<p>began to think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some</p>
<p>mischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey</p>
<p>towards the great city, ‘For there,’ thought he, ‘I may turn musician.’</p>
<p>After he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the</p>
<p>roadside and panting as if he were tired. ‘What makes you pant so, my</p>
<p>friend?’ said the ass. ‘Alas!’ said the dog, ‘my master was going to</p>
<p>knock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make</p>
<p>myself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to</p>
<p>earn my livelihood?’ ‘Hark ye!’ said the ass, ‘I am going to the great</p>
<p>city to turn musician: suppose you go with me, and try what you can</p>
<p>do in the same way?’ The dog said he was willing, and they jogged on</p>
<p>together.</p>
<p>They had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the</p>
<p>road and making a most rueful face. ‘Pray, my good lady,’ said the ass,</p>
<p>‘what’s the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!’ ‘Ah, me!’</p>
<p>said the cat, ‘how can one be in good spirits when one’s life is in</p>
<p>danger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my</p>
<p>ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress</p>
<p>laid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky</p>
<p>enough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.’</p>
<p>‘Oh,’ said the ass, ‘by all means go with us to the great city; you are</p>
<p>a good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.’ The cat</p>
<p>was pleased with the thought, and joined the party.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock</p>
<p>perched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main.</p>
<p>‘Bravo!’ said the ass; ‘upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what</p>
<p>is all this about?’ ‘Why,’ said the cock, ‘I was just now saying that</p>
<p>we should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and</p>
<p>the cook don’t thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my</p>
<p>head tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming</p>
<p>on Sunday!’ ‘Heaven forbid!’ said the ass, ‘come with us Master</p>
<p>Chanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have</p>
<p>your head cut off! Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we</p>
<p>may get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.’ ‘With all my</p>
<p>heart,’ said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.</p>
<p>They could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when</p>
<p>night came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laid</p>
<p>themselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the</p>
<p>branches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he</p>
<p>should be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to</p>
<p>his custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to</p>
<p>see that everything was well. In doing this, he saw afar off something</p>
<p>bright and shining and calling to his companions said, ‘There must be a</p>
<p>house no great way off, for I see a light.’ ‘If that be the case,’ said</p>
<p>the ass, ‘we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the</p>
<p>best in the world!’ ‘Besides,’ added the dog, ‘I should not be the</p>
<p>worse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.’ So they walked off together</p>
<p>towards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew</p>
<p>near it became larger and brighter, till they at last came close to a</p>
<p>house in which a gang of robbers lived.</p>
<p>The ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and</p>
<p>peeped in. ‘Well, Donkey,’ said Chanticleer, ‘what do you see?’ ‘What</p>
<p>do I see?’ replied the ass. ‘Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of</p>
<p>good things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.’ ‘That would</p>
<p>be a noble lodging for us,’ said the cock. ‘Yes,’ said the ass, ‘if we</p>
<p>could only get in’; so they consulted together how they should contrive</p>
<p>to get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placed</p>
<p>himself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the</p>
<p>window; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog’s</p>
<p>shoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat’s head. When</p>
<p>all was ready a signal was given, and they began their music. The ass</p>
<p>brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then</p>
<p>they all broke through the window at once, and came tumbling into</p>
<p>the room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter! The</p>
<p>robbers, who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert,</p>
<p>had now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them,</p>
<p>and scampered away as fast as they could.</p>
<p>The coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what</p>
<p>the robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected</p>
<p>to eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves, they</p>
<p>put out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to</p>
<p>his own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in</p>
<p>the yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the</p>
<p>cat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the</p>
<p>cock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and, as they were all</p>
<p>rather tired with their journey, they soon fell asleep.</p>
<p>But about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were</p>
<p>out and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in</p>
<p>too great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than</p>
<p>the rest, went to see what was going on. Finding everything still, he</p>
<p>marched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in</p>
<p>order to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of</p>
<p>the cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to</p>
<p>light it. But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face,</p>
<p>and spat, and scratched at him. This frightened him dreadfully, and away</p>
<p>he ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the</p>
<p>leg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the</p>
<p>cock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might. At</p>
<p>this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told</p>
<p>the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at</p>
<p>him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a</p>
<p>knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him</p>
<p>in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a</p>
<p>club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out,</p>
<p>‘Throw the rascal up here!’ After this the robbers never dared to go</p>
<p>back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters</p>
<p>that they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at</p>
<p>this very day.</p>
