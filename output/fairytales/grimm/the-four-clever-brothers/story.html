            <p>‘Dear children,’ said a poor man to his four sons, ‘I have nothing to</p>
<p>give you; you must go out into the wide world and try your luck. Begin</p>
<p>by learning some craft or another, and see how you can get on.’ So the</p>
<p>four brothers took their walking-sticks in their hands, and their little</p>
<p>bundles on their shoulders, and after bidding their father goodbye, went</p>
<p>all out at the gate together. When they had got on some way they came</p>
<p>to four crossways, each leading to a different country. Then the eldest</p>
<p>said, ‘Here we must part; but this day four years we will come back</p>
<p>to this spot, and in the meantime each must try what he can do for</p>
<p>himself.’</p>
<p>So each brother went his way; and as the eldest was hastening on a man</p>
<p>met him, and asked him where he was going, and what he wanted. ‘I am</p>
<p>going to try my luck in the world, and should like to begin by learning</p>
<p>some art or trade,’ answered he. ‘Then,’ said the man, ‘go with me, and</p>
<p>I will teach you to become the cunningest thief that ever was.’ ‘No,’</p>
<p>said the other, ‘that is not an honest calling, and what can one look</p>
<p>to earn by it in the end but the gallows?’ ‘Oh!’ said the man, ‘you need</p>
<p>not fear the gallows; for I will only teach you to steal what will be</p>
<p>fair game: I meddle with nothing but what no one else can get or care</p>
<p>anything about, and where no one can find you out.’ So the young man</p>
<p>agreed to follow his trade, and he soon showed himself so clever, that</p>
<p>nothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon.</p>
<p>The second brother also met a man, who, when he found out what he was</p>
<p>setting out upon, asked him what craft he meant to follow. ‘I do not</p>
<p>know yet,’ said he. ‘Then come with me, and be a star-gazer. It is a</p>
<p>noble art, for nothing can be hidden from you, when once you understand</p>
<p>the stars.’ The plan pleased him much, and he soon became such a skilful</p>
<p>star-gazer, that when he had served out his time, and wanted to leave</p>
<p>his master, he gave him a glass, and said, ‘With this you can see all</p>
<p>that is passing in the sky and on earth, and nothing can be hidden from</p>
<p>you.’</p>
<p>The third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught him</p>
<p>so well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very clever in the</p>
<p>craft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow, and</p>
<p>said, ‘Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.’</p>
<p>The youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to</p>
<p>do. ‘Would not you like,’ said he, ‘to be a tailor?’ ‘Oh, no!’ said</p>
<p>the young man; ‘sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working</p>
<p>backwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.’</p>
<p>‘Oh!’ answered the man, ‘that is not my sort of tailoring; come with me,</p>
<p>and you will learn quite another kind of craft from that.’ Not knowing</p>
<p>what better to do, he came into the plan, and learnt tailoring from the</p>
<p>beginning; and when he left his master, he gave him a needle, and said,</p>
<p>‘You can sew anything with this, be it as soft as an egg or as hard as</p>
<p>steel; and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen.’</p>
<p>After the space of four years, at the time agreed upon, the four</p>
<p>brothers met at the four cross-roads; and having welcomed each other,</p>
<p>set off towards their father’s home, where they told him all that had</p>
<p>happened to them, and how each had learned some craft.</p>
<p>Then, one day, as they were sitting before the house under a very high</p>
<p>tree, the father said, ‘I should like to try what each of you can do in</p>
<p>this way.’ So he looked up, and said to the second son, ‘At the top of</p>
<p>this tree there is a chaffinch’s nest; tell me how many eggs there are</p>
<p>in it.’ The star-gazer took his glass, looked up, and said, ‘Five.’</p>
<p>‘Now,’ said the father to the eldest son, ‘take away the eggs without</p>
<p>letting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them know</p>
<p>anything of what you are doing.’ So the cunning thief climbed up the</p>
<p>tree, and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the bird;</p>
<p>and it never saw or felt what he was doing, but kept sitting on at its</p>
<p>ease. Then the father took the eggs, and put one on each corner of the</p>
<p>table, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman, ‘Cut all</p>
<p>the eggs in two pieces at one shot.’ The huntsman took up his bow, and</p>
<p>at one shot struck all the five eggs as his father wished.</p>
<p>‘Now comes your turn,’ said he to the young tailor; ‘sew the eggs and</p>
<p>the young birds in them together again, so neatly that the shot shall</p>
<p>have done them no harm.’ Then the tailor took his needle, and sewed the</p>
<p>eggs as he was told; and when he had done, the thief was sent to take</p>
<p>them back to the nest, and put them under the bird without its knowing</p>
<p>it. Then she went on sitting, and hatched them: and in a few days they</p>
<p>crawled out, and had only a little red streak across their necks, where</p>
<p>the tailor had sewn them together.</p>
<p>‘Well done, sons!’ said the old man; ‘you have made good use of your</p>
<p>time, and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not</p>
<p>know which ought to have the prize. Oh, that a time might soon come for</p>
<p>you to turn your skill to some account!’</p>
<p>Not long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the</p>
<p>king’s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the king</p>
<p>mourned over his loss day and night, and made it known that whoever</p>
<p>brought her back to him should have her for a wife. Then the four</p>
<p>brothers said to each other, ‘Here is a chance for us; let us try</p>
<p>what we can do.’ And they agreed to see whether they could not set the</p>
<p>princess free. ‘I will soon find out where she is, however,’ said the</p>
<p>star-gazer, as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried out, ‘I</p>
<p>see her afar off, sitting upon a rock in the sea, and I can spy the</p>
<p>dragon close by, guarding her.’ Then he went to the king, and asked for</p>
<p>a ship for himself and his brothers; and they sailed together over the</p>
<p>sea, till they came to the right place. There they found the princess</p>
<p>sitting, as the star-gazer had said, on the rock; and the dragon was</p>
<p>lying asleep, with his head upon her lap. ‘I dare not shoot at him,’</p>
<p>said the huntsman, ‘for I should kill the beautiful young lady also.’</p>
<p>‘Then I will try my skill,’ said the thief, and went and stole her away</p>
<p>from under the dragon, so quietly and gently that the beast did not know</p>
<p>it, but went on snoring.</p>
<p>Then away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the</p>
<p>ship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for</p>
<p>he awoke and missed the princess. But when he got over the boat, and</p>
<p>wanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess, the huntsman took</p>
<p>up his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down</p>
<p>dead. They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in</p>
<p>his fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea</p>
<p>upon a few planks. So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large</p>
<p>stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these,</p>
<p>and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked</p>
<p>them together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then</p>
<p>reached the ship and got home safe.</p>
<p>When they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great</p>
<p>rejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, ‘One of you shall marry</p>
<p>her, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.’ Then</p>
<p>there arose a quarrel between them; and the star-gazer said, ‘If I had</p>
<p>not found the princess out, all your skill would have been of no use;</p>
<p>therefore she ought to be mine.’ ‘Your seeing her would have been of</p>
<p>no use,’ said the thief, ‘if I had not taken her away from the dragon;</p>
<p>therefore she ought to be mine.’ ‘No, she is mine,’ said the huntsman;</p>
<p>‘for if I had not killed the dragon, he would, after all, have torn you</p>
<p>and the princess into pieces.’ ‘And if I had not sewn the boat together</p>
<p>again,’ said the tailor, ‘you would all have been drowned, therefore she</p>
<p>is mine.’ Then the king put in a word, and said, ‘Each of you is right;</p>
<p>and as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of</p>
<p>you to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great</p>
<p>deal better. But to make up for your loss, I will give each of you, as a</p>
<p>reward for his skill, half a kingdom.’ So the brothers agreed that this</p>
<p>plan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who</p>
<p>had no mind to have them. And the king then gave to each half a kingdom,</p>
<p>as he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and</p>
<p>took good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the</p>
<p>young lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have</p>
<p>her again.</p>
