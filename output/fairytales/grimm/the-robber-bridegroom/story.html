        <div class="story-content">
            <p>There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was</p>
<p>grown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided</p>
<p>for. He said to himself, ‘I will give her to the first suitable man who</p>
<p>comes and asks for her hand.’ Not long after a suitor appeared, and as</p>
<p>he appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him with</p>
<p>which to find fault, he betrothed his daughter to him. But the girl did</p>
<p>not care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband.</p>
<p>She did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him</p>
<p>nor think of him without an inward shudder. One day he said to her, ‘You</p>
<p>have not yet paid me a visit, although we have been betrothed for some</p>
<p>time.’ ‘I do not know where your house is,’ she answered. ‘My house is</p>
<p>out there in the dark forest,’ he said. She tried to excuse herself by</p>
<p>saying that she would not be able to find the way thither. Her betrothed</p>
<p>only replied, ‘You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already</p>
<p>invited guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I</p>
<p>will strew ashes along the path.’</p>
<p>When Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of</p>
<p>dread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might</p>
<p>be able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and</p>
<p>lentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching the</p>
<p>entrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these</p>
<p>she followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at every</p>
<p>step she took. She walked the whole day until she came to the deepest,</p>
<p>darkest part of the forest. There she saw a lonely house, looking so</p>
<p>grim and mysterious, that it did not please her at all. She stepped</p>
<p>inside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence reigned</p>
<p>throughout. Suddenly a voice cried:</p>
<p>‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,</p>
<p>Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’</p>
<p>The girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a</p>
<p>cage on the wall. Again it cried:</p>
<p>‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,</p>
<p>Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’</p>
<p>The girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they were</p>
<p>all empty, and still she saw no one. At last she came to the cellar,</p>
<p>and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head from</p>
<p>shaking. ‘Can you tell me,’ asked the girl, ‘if my betrothed husband</p>
<p>lives here?’</p>
<p>‘Ah, you poor child,’ answered the old woman, ‘what a place for you to</p>
<p>come to! This is a murderers’ den. You think yourself a promised bride,</p>
<p>and that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with death that</p>
<p>you will keep your marriage feast. Look, do you see that large cauldron</p>
<p>of water which I am obliged to keep on the fire! As soon as they have</p>
<p>you in their power they will kill you without mercy, and cook and eat</p>
<p>you, for they are eaters of men. If I did not take pity on you and save</p>
<p>you, you would be lost.’</p>
<p>Thereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid her</p>
<p>from view. ‘Keep as still as a mouse,’ she said; ‘do not move or speak,</p>
<p>or it will be all over with you. Tonight, when the robbers are</p>
<p>all asleep, we will flee together. I have long been waiting for an</p>
<p>opportunity to escape.’</p>
<p>The words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned,</p>
<p>dragging another young girl along with them. They were all drunk, and</p>
<p>paid no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her wine to drink,</p>
<p>three glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow,</p>
<p>and with that her heart gave way and she died. Then they tore off her</p>
<p>dainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into</p>
<p>pieces, and sprinkled salt upon it.</p>
<p>The poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the</p>
<p>cask, for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by</p>
<p>the robbers. One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on</p>
<p>the little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off</p>
<p>easily, he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang</p>
<p>into the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was</p>
<p>hiding there. The robber took a light and began looking for it, but he</p>
<p>could not find it. ‘Have you looked behind the large cask?’ said one of</p>
<p>the others. But the old woman called out, ‘Come and eat your suppers,</p>
<p>and let the thing be till tomorrow; the finger won’t run away.’</p>
<p>‘The old woman is right,’ said the robbers, and they ceased looking for</p>
<p>the finger and sat down.</p>
<p>The old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine, and before</p>
<p>long they were all lying on the floor of the cellar, fast asleep and</p>
<p>snoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this, she came from behind</p>
<p>the cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who</p>
<p>were lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed</p>
<p>dread lest she should awaken them. But God helped her, so that she</p>
<p>passed safely over them, and then she and the old woman went upstairs,</p>
<p>opened the door, and hastened as fast as they could from the murderers’</p>
<p>den. They found the ashes scattered by the wind, but the peas and</p>
<p>lentils had sprouted, and grown sufficiently above the ground, to guide</p>
<p>them in the moonlight along the path. All night long they walked, and it</p>
<p>was morning before they reached the mill. Then the girl told her father</p>
<p>all that had happened.</p>
<p>The day came that had been fixed for the marriage. The bridegroom</p>
<p>arrived and also a large company of guests, for the miller had taken</p>
<p>care to invite all his friends and relations. As they sat at the feast,</p>
<p>each guest in turn was asked to tell a tale; the bride sat still and did</p>
<p>not say a word.</p>
<p>‘And you, my love,’ said the bridegroom, turning to her, ‘is there no</p>
<p>tale you know? Tell us something.’</p>
<p>‘I will tell you a dream, then,’ said the bride. ‘I went alone through a</p>
<p>forest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within, but</p>
<p>a bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried:</p>
<p>‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,</p>
<p>Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’</p>
<p>and again a second time it said these words.’</p>
<p>‘My darling, this is only a dream.’</p>
<p>‘I went on through the house from room to room, but they were all empty,</p>
<p>and everything was so grim and mysterious. At last I went down to the</p>
<p>cellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her</p>
<p>head still. I asked her if my betrothed lived here, and she answered,</p>
<p>“Ah, you poor child, you are come to a murderers’ den; your betrothed</p>
<p>does indeed live here, but he will kill you without mercy and afterwards</p>
<p>cook and eat you.”’</p>
<p>‘My darling, this is only a dream.’</p>
<p>‘The old woman hid me behind a large cask, and scarcely had she done</p>
<p>this when the robbers returned home, dragging a young girl along with</p>
<p>them. They gave her three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and</p>
<p>yellow, and with that she died.’</p>
<p>‘My darling, this is only a dream.’</p>
<p>‘Then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body into</p>
<p>pieces and sprinkled salt upon it.’</p>
<p>‘My darling, this is only a dream.’</p>
<p>‘And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on her</p>
<p>finger, and as it was difficult to draw off, he took a hatchet and cut</p>
<p>off her finger; but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind the</p>
<p>great cask into my lap. And here is the finger with the ring.’ And</p>
<p>with these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to the</p>
<p>assembled guests.</p>
<p>The bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and</p>
<p>tried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast. They</p>
<p>delivered him up to justice, and he and all his murderous band were</p>
<p>condemned to death for their wicked deeds.</p>
