            <p>There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull</p>
<p>of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly</p>
<p>hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run</p>
<p>out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so</p>
<p>the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,</p>
<p>and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough</p>
<p>of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of</p>
<p>tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it</p>
<p>fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said</p>
<p>nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few</p>
<p>half-pence, out of which he had to eat.</p>
<p>They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old</p>
<p>began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are</p>
<p>you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’</p>
<p>answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’</p>
<p>The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently</p>
<p>began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and</p>
<p>henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he</p>
<p>did spill a little of anything.</p>
