        <div class="story-content">
            <p>There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of</p>
<p>the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore</p>
<p>white and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the</p>
<p>two rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red.</p>
<p>They were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children</p>
<p>in the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than</p>
<p>Rose-red. Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields</p>
<p>seeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home</p>
<p>with her mother, and helped her with her housework, or read to her when</p>
<p>there was nothing to do.</p>
<p>The two children were so fond of one another that they always held each</p>
<p>other by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said:</p>
<p>‘We will not leave each other,’ Rose-red answered: ‘Never so long as we</p>
<p>live,’ and their mother would add: ‘What one has she must share with the</p>
<p>other.’</p>
<p>They often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no</p>
<p>beasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little</p>
<p>hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by</p>
<p>their side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon</p>
<p>the boughs, and sang whatever they knew.</p>
<p>No mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest, and</p>
<p>night came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss,</p>
<p>and slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and did not</p>
<p>worry on their account.</p>
<p>Once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused</p>
<p>them, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near</p>
<p>their bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing</p>
<p>and went into the forest. And when they looked round they found that</p>
<p>they had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly</p>
<p>have fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces</p>
<p>further. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who</p>
<p>watches over good children.</p>
<p>Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother’s little cottage so neat that</p>
<p>it was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took care</p>
<p>of the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother’s</p>
<p>bed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter</p>
<p>Snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob. The kettle</p>
<p>was of brass and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished. In the</p>
<p>evening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said: ‘Go, Snow-white, and</p>
<p>bolt the door,’ and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took</p>
<p>her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls</p>
<p>listened as they sat and spun. And close by them lay a lamb upon the</p>
<p>floor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head</p>
<p>hidden beneath its wings.</p>
<p>One evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, someone</p>
<p>knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said:</p>
<p>‘Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking</p>
<p>shelter.’ Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a</p>
<p>poor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black</p>
<p>head within the door.</p>
<p>Rose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered,</p>
<p>and Snow-white hid herself behind her mother’s bed. But the bear began</p>
<p>to speak and said: ‘Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm! I am</p>
<p>half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.’</p>
<p>‘Poor bear,’ said the mother, ‘lie down by the fire, only take care that</p>
<p>you do not burn your coat.’ Then she cried: ‘Snow-white, Rose-red, come</p>
<p>out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.’ So they both came</p>
<p>out, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid</p>
<p>of him. The bear said: ‘Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a</p>
<p>little’; so they brought the broom and swept the bear’s hide clean;</p>
<p>and he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and</p>
<p>comfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played</p>
<p>tricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands,</p>
<p>put their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a</p>
<p>hazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed. But the</p>
<p>bear took it all in good part, only when they were too rough he called</p>
<p>out: ‘Leave me alive, children,</p>
<p>Snow-white, Rose-red,</p>
<p>Will you beat your wooer dead?’</p>
<p>When it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the</p>
<p>bear: ‘You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe from</p>
<p>the cold and the bad weather.’ As soon as day dawned the two children</p>
<p>let him out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest.</p>
<p>Henceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself</p>
<p>down by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as</p>
<p>much as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were</p>
<p>never fastened until their black friend had arrived.</p>
<p>When spring had come and all outside was green, the bear said one</p>
<p>morning to Snow-white: ‘Now I must go away, and cannot come back for the</p>
<p>whole summer.’ ‘Where are you going, then, dear bear?’ asked Snow-white.</p>
<p>‘I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked</p>
<p>dwarfs. In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged</p>
<p>to stay below and cannot work their way through; but now, when the sun</p>
<p>has thawed and warmed the earth, they break through it, and come out to</p>
<p>pry and steal; and what once gets into their hands, and in their caves,</p>
<p>does not easily see daylight again.’</p>
<p>Snow-white was quite sorry at his departure, and as she unbolted the</p>
<p>door for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against the bolt</p>
<p>and a piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to Snow-white</p>
<p>as if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about</p>
<p>it. The bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the</p>
<p>trees.</p>
<p>A short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest</p>
<p>to get firewood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the</p>
<p>ground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and</p>
<p>forwards in the grass, but they could not make out what it was. When</p>
<p>they came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a</p>
<p>snow-white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught in a</p>
<p>crevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping about like a dog</p>
<p>tied to a rope, and did not know what to do.</p>
<p>He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried: ‘Why do you</p>
<p>stand there? Can you not come here and help me?’ ‘What are you up to,</p>
<p>little man?’ asked Rose-red. ‘You stupid, prying goose!’ answered the</p>
<p>dwarf: ‘I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking.</p>
<p>The little bit of food that we people get is immediately burnt up with</p>
<p>heavy logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. I had</p>
<p>just driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished;</p>
<p>but the cursed wedge was too smooth and suddenly sprang out, and the</p>
<p>tree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white</p>
<p>beard; so now it is tight and I cannot get away, and the silly, sleek,</p>
<p>milk-faced things laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!’</p>
<p>The children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out, it</p>
<p>was caught too fast. ‘I will run and fetch someone,’ said Rose-red. ‘You</p>
<p>senseless goose!’ snarled the dwarf; ‘why should you fetch someone? You</p>
<p>are already two too many for me; can you not think of something better?’</p>
<p>‘Don’t be impatient,’ said Snow-white, ‘I will help you,’ and she pulled</p>
<p>her scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard.</p>
<p>As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay</p>
<p>amongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted it</p>
<p>up, grumbling to himself: ‘Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my fine</p>
<p>beard. Bad luck to you!’ and then he swung the bag upon his back, and</p>
<p>went off without even once looking at the children.</p>
<p>Some time afterwards Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish</p>
<p>of fish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a large</p>
<p>grasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in.</p>
<p>They ran to it and found it was the dwarf. ‘Where are you going?’ said</p>
<p>Rose-red; ‘you surely don’t want to go into the water?’ ‘I am not such</p>
<p>a fool!’ cried the dwarf; ‘don’t you see that the accursed fish wants</p>
<p>to pull me in?’ The little man had been sitting there fishing, and</p>
<p>unluckily the wind had tangled up his beard with the fishing-line; a</p>
<p>moment later a big fish made a bite and the feeble creature had not</p>
<p>strength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the</p>
<p>dwarf towards him. He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it was of</p>
<p>little good, for he was forced to follow the movements of the fish, and</p>
<p>was in urgent danger of being dragged into the water.</p>
<p>The girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his</p>
<p>beard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled fast</p>
<p>together. There was nothing to do but to bring out the scissors and cut</p>
<p>the beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf saw that</p>
<p>he screamed out: ‘Is that civil, you toadstool, to disfigure a man’s</p>
<p>face? Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard? Now you have</p>
<p>cut off the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by my people.</p>
<p>I wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!’ Then he took</p>
<p>out a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without another word</p>
<p>he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.</p>
<p>It happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the</p>
<p>town to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road led them</p>
<p>across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn about. There</p>
<p>they noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and</p>
<p>round above them; it sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a</p>
<p>rock not far away. Immediately they heard a loud, piteous cry. They ran</p>
<p>up and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance</p>
<p>the dwarf, and was going to carry him off.</p>
<p>The children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man,</p>
<p>and pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go.</p>
<p>As soon as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried</p>
<p>with his shrill voice: ‘Could you not have done it more carefully! You</p>
<p>dragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you</p>
<p>clumsy creatures!’ Then he took up a sack full of precious stones, and</p>
<p>slipped away again under the rock into his hole. The girls, who by</p>
<p>this time were used to his ingratitude, went on their way and did their</p>
<p>business in town.</p>
<p>As they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the</p>
<p>dwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot,</p>
<p>and had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening</p>
<p>sun shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and sparkled with</p>
<p>all colours so beautifully that the children stood still and stared</p>
<p>at them. ‘Why do you stand gaping there?’ cried the dwarf, and his</p>
<p>ashen-grey face became copper-red with rage. He was still cursing when a</p>
<p>loud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out</p>
<p>of the forest. The dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could not reach</p>
<p>his cave, for the bear was already close. Then in the dread of his heart</p>
<p>he cried: ‘Dear Mr Bear, spare me, I will give you all my treasures;</p>
<p>look, the beautiful jewels lying there! Grant me my life; what do you</p>
<p>want with such a slender little fellow as I? you would not feel me</p>
<p>between your teeth. Come, take these two wicked girls, they are tender</p>
<p>morsels for you, fat as young quails; for mercy’s sake eat them!’ The</p>
<p>bear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature a single</p>
<p>blow with his paw, and he did not move again.</p>
<p>The girls had run away, but the bear called to them: ‘Snow-white and</p>
<p>Rose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.’ Then they</p>
<p>recognized his voice and waited, and when he came up to them suddenly</p>
<p>his bearskin fell off, and he stood there a handsome man, clothed all in</p>
<p>gold. ‘I am a king’s son,’ he said, ‘and I was bewitched by that wicked</p>
<p>dwarf, who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run about the forest</p>
<p>as a savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now he has got his</p>
<p>well-deserved punishment.</p>
<p>Snow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother, and they</p>
<p>divided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered</p>
<p>together in his cave. The old mother lived peacefully and happily with</p>
<p>her children for many years. She took the two rose-trees with her, and</p>
<p>they stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful</p>
<p>roses, white and red.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>The Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859), were born</p>
<p>in Hanau, near Frankfurt, in the German state of Hesse. Throughout</p>
<p>their lives they remained close friends, and both studied law at Marburg</p>
<p>University. Jacob was a pioneer in the study of German philology,</p>
<p>and although Wilhelm’s work was hampered by poor health the brothers</p>
<p>collaborated in the creation of a German dictionary, not completed until</p>
<p>a century after their deaths. But they were best (and universally) known</p>
<p>for the collection of over two hundred folk tales they made from oral</p>
<p>sources and published in two volumes of ‘Nursery and Household Tales’ in</p>
<p>1812 and 1814. Although their intention was to preserve such material as</p>
<p>part of German cultural and literary history, and their collection was</p>
<p>first published with scholarly notes and no illustration, the tales soon</p>
<p>came into the possession of young readers. This was in part due to Edgar</p>
<p>Taylor, who made the first English translation in 1823, selecting about</p>
<p>fifty stories ‘with the amusement of some young friends principally in</p>
<p>view.’ They have been an essential ingredient of children’s reading ever</p>
<p>since.</p>
