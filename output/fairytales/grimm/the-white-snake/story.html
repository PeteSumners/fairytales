        <div class="story-content">
            <p>A long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through</p>
<p>all the land. Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of</p>
<p>the most secret things was brought to him through the air. But he had a</p>
<p>strange custom; every day after dinner, when the table was cleared,</p>
<p>and no one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him one more</p>
<p>dish. It was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what</p>
<p>was in it, neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the</p>
<p>cover to eat of it until he was quite alone.</p>
<p>This had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took</p>
<p>away the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help</p>
<p>carrying the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked the door,</p>
<p>he lifted up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish. But</p>
<p>when he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it,</p>
<p>so he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth. No sooner had it</p>
<p>touched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices</p>
<p>outside his window. He went and listened, and then noticed that it was</p>
<p>the sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one another of</p>
<p>all kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods. Eating</p>
<p>the snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals.</p>
<p>Now it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most</p>
<p>beautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty</p>
<p>servant, who was allowed to go everywhere. The king ordered the man to</p>
<p>be brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he</p>
<p>could before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked</p>
<p>upon as guilty and executed. In vain he declared his innocence; he was</p>
<p>dismissed with no better answer.</p>
<p>In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought</p>
<p>how to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks were sitting</p>
<p>together quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they</p>
<p>were making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a</p>
<p>confidential conversation together. The servant stood by and listened.</p>
<p>They were telling one another of all the places where they had been</p>
<p>waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and</p>
<p>one said in a pitiful tone: ‘Something lies heavy on my stomach; as</p>
<p>I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen’s</p>
<p>window.’ The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the</p>
<p>kitchen, and said to the cook: ‘Here is a fine duck; pray, kill her.’</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ said the cook, and weighed her in his hand; ‘she has spared</p>
<p>no trouble to fatten herself, and has been waiting to be roasted long</p>
<p>enough.’ So he cut off her head, and as she was being dressed for the</p>
<p>spit, the queen’s ring was found inside her.</p>
<p>The servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make</p>
<p>amends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him</p>
<p>the best place in the court that he could wish for. The servant refused</p>
<p>everything, and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling, as</p>
<p>he had a mind to see the world and go about a little. When his request</p>
<p>was granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he</p>
<p>saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water. Now, though</p>
<p>it is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must</p>
<p>perish so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart, he got off his</p>
<p>horse and put the three prisoners back into the water. They leapt with</p>
<p>delight, put out their heads, and cried to him: ‘We will remember you</p>
<p>and repay you for saving us!’</p>
<p>He rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in</p>
<p>the sand at his feet. He listened, and heard an ant-king complain: ‘Why</p>
<p>cannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies? That stupid</p>
<p>horse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without</p>
<p>mercy!’ So he turned on to a side path and the ant-king cried out to</p>
<p>him: ‘We will remember you--one good turn deserves another!’</p>
<p>The path led him into a wood, and there he saw two old ravens standing</p>
<p>by their nest, and throwing out their young ones. ‘Out with you, you</p>
<p>idle, good-for-nothing creatures!’ cried they; ‘we cannot find food for</p>
<p>you any longer; you are big enough, and can provide for yourselves.’</p>
<p>But the poor young ravens lay upon the ground, flapping their wings, and</p>
<p>crying: ‘Oh, what helpless chicks we are! We must shift for ourselves,</p>
<p>and yet we cannot fly! What can we do, but lie here and starve?’ So the</p>
<p>good young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword, and gave</p>
<p>it to them for food. Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their</p>
<p>hunger, and cried: ‘We will remember you--one good turn deserves</p>
<p>another!’</p>
<p>And now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a long</p>
<p>way, he came to a large city. There was a great noise and crowd in</p>
<p>the streets, and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud: ‘The king’s</p>
<p>daughter wants a husband; but whoever seeks her hand must perform a hard</p>
<p>task, and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life.’ Many had</p>
<p>already made the attempt, but in vain; nevertheless when the youth</p>
<p>saw the king’s daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he</p>
<p>forgot all danger, went before the king, and declared himself a suitor.</p>
<p>So he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it, before</p>
<p>his eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the</p>
<p>bottom of the sea, and added: ‘If you come up again without it you will</p>
<p>be thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves.’ All the</p>
<p>people grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him</p>
<p>alone by the sea.</p>
<p>He stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly</p>
<p>he saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they were the very</p>
<p>fishes whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel in</p>
<p>its mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth’s feet, and when he</p>
<p>had taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell.</p>
<p>Full of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him</p>
<p>the promised reward.</p>
<p>But when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in</p>
<p>birth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another</p>
<p>task. She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten</p>
<p>sacksful of millet-seed on the grass; then she said: ‘Tomorrow morning</p>
<p>before sunrise these must be picked up, and not a single grain be</p>
<p>wanting.’</p>
<p>The youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible</p>
<p>to perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he sat</p>
<p>sorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death.</p>
<p>But as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw</p>
<p>all the ten sacks standing side by side, quite full, and not a single</p>
<p>grain was missing. The ant-king had come in the night with thousands</p>
<p>and thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had by great industry</p>
<p>picked up all the millet-seed and gathered them into the sacks.</p>
<p>Presently the king’s daughter herself came down into the garden, and was</p>
<p>amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him.</p>
<p>But she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said: ‘Although he</p>
<p>has performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband until he had</p>
<p>brought me an apple from the Tree of Life.’ The youth did not know where</p>
<p>the Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and would have gone on for ever,</p>
<p>as long as his legs would carry him, though he had no hope of finding</p>
<p>it. After he had wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to</p>
<p>a wood, and lay down under a tree to sleep. But he heard a rustling in</p>
<p>the branches, and a golden apple fell into his hand. At the same time</p>
<p>three ravens flew down to him, perched themselves upon his knee, and</p>
<p>said: ‘We are the three young ravens whom you saved from starving; when</p>
<p>we had grown big, and heard that you were seeking the Golden Apple,</p>
<p>we flew over the sea to the end of the world, where the Tree of Life</p>
<p>stands, and have brought you the apple.’ The youth, full of joy, set out</p>
<p>homewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king’s beautiful daughter,</p>
<p>who had now no more excuses left to make. They cut the Apple of Life in</p>
<p>two and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him,</p>
<p>and they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.</p>
