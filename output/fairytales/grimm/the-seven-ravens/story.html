            <p>There was once a man who had seven sons, and last of all one daughter.</p>
<p>Although the little girl was very pretty, she was so weak and small that</p>
<p>they thought she could not live; but they said she should at once be</p>
<p>christened.</p>
<p>So the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get some</p>
<p>water, but the other six ran with him. Each wanted to be first at</p>
<p>drawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their</p>
<p>pitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at</p>
<p>one another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home. In the</p>
<p>meantime the father was uneasy, and could not tell what made the</p>
<p>young men stay so long. ‘Surely,’ said he, ‘the whole seven must have</p>
<p>forgotten themselves over some game of play’; and when he had waited</p>
<p>still longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished</p>
<p>them all turned into ravens. Scarcely had he spoken these words when he</p>
<p>heard a croaking over his head, and looked up and saw seven ravens as</p>
<p>black as coal flying round and round. Sorry as he was to see his wish</p>
<p>so fulfilled, he did not know how what was done could be undone, and</p>
<p>comforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons</p>
<p>with his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and every day</p>
<p>more beautiful.</p>
<p>For a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers; for</p>
<p>her father and mother took care not to speak of them before her: but one</p>
<p>day by chance she heard the people about her speak of them. ‘Yes,’ said</p>
<p>they, ‘she is beautiful indeed, but still ‘tis a pity that her brothers</p>
<p>should have been lost for her sake.’ Then she was much grieved, and went</p>
<p>to her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what</p>
<p>had become of them. So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but</p>
<p>said it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent</p>
<p>cause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and</p>
<p>thought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back;</p>
<p>and she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole</p>
<p>away, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever</p>
<p>they might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her.</p>
<p>She took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother</p>
<p>had given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry, a little</p>
<p>pitcher of water in case she should be thirsty, and a little stool</p>
<p>to rest upon when she should be weary. Thus she went on and on, and</p>
<p>journeyed till she came to the world’s end; then she came to the sun,</p>
<p>but the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to</p>
<p>the moon, but the moon was cold and chilly, and said, ‘I smell flesh</p>
<p>and blood this way!’ so she took herself away in a hurry and came to the</p>
<p>stars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her, and each star sat</p>
<p>upon his own little stool; but the morning star rose up and gave her a</p>
<p>little piece of wood, and said, ‘If you have not this little piece of</p>
<p>wood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass-mountain,</p>
<p>and there your brothers live.’ The little girl took the piece of wood,</p>
<p>rolled it up in a little cloth, and went on again until she came to the</p>
<p>glass-mountain, and found the door shut. Then she felt for the little</p>
<p>piece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there, and</p>
<p>she saw she had lost the gift of the good stars. What was to be done?</p>
<p>She wanted to save her brothers, and had no key of the castle of the</p>
<p>glass-mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her</p>
<p>pocket and cut off her little finger, that was just the size of the</p>
<p>piece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door and opened it.</p>
<p>As she went in, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, ‘What are you</p>
<p>seeking for?’ ‘I seek for my brothers, the seven ravens,’ answered she.</p>
<p>Then the dwarf said, ‘My masters are not at home; but if you will wait</p>
<p>till they come, pray step in.’ Now the little dwarf was getting their</p>
<p>dinner ready, and he brought their food upon seven little plates, and</p>
<p>their drink in seven little glasses, and set them upon the table, and</p>
<p>out of each little plate their sister ate a small piece, and out of each</p>
<p>little glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that she had</p>
<p>brought with her fall into the last glass.</p>
<p>On a sudden she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air, and the</p>
<p>dwarf said, ‘Here come my masters.’ When they came in, they wanted to</p>
<p>eat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said</p>
<p>one after the other,</p>
<p>‘Who has eaten from my little plate? And who has been drinking out of my</p>
<p>little glass?’</p>
<p>‘Caw! Caw! well I ween</p>
<p>Mortal lips have this way been.’</p>
<p>When the seventh came to the bottom of his glass, and found there the</p>
<p>ring, he looked at it, and knew that it was his father’s and mother’s,</p>
<p>and said, ‘O that our little sister would but come! then we should be</p>
<p>free.’ When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door</p>
<p>all the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all</p>
<p>the ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each</p>
<p>other, and went merrily home.</p>
