        <div class="story-content">
            <p>There was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich</p>
<p>peasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. He</p>
<p>had not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and</p>
<p>yet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her:</p>
<p>‘Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall</p>
<p>make us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any</p>
<p>other, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.’ the woman</p>
<p>also liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed</p>
<p>the calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head</p>
<p>hanging down as if it were eating.</p>
<p>Next morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant</p>
<p>called the cow-herd in and said: ‘Look, I have a little calf there,</p>
<p>but it is still small and has to be carried.’ The cow-herd said: ‘All</p>
<p>right,’ and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set</p>
<p>it among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like one</p>
<p>which was eating, and the cow-herd said: ‘It will soon run by itself,</p>
<p>just look how it eats already!’ At night when he was going to drive the</p>
<p>herd home again, he said to the calf: ‘If you can stand there and eat</p>
<p>your fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don’t care to drag you</p>
<p>home again in my arms.’ But the little peasant stood at his door, and</p>
<p>waited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through</p>
<p>the village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was. The</p>
<p>cow-herd answered: ‘It is still standing out there eating. It would not</p>
<p>stop and come with us.’ But the little peasant said: ‘Oh, but I must</p>
<p>have my beast back again.’ Then they went back to the meadow together,</p>
<p>but someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone. The cow-herd said: ‘It</p>
<p>must have run away.’ The peasant, however, said: ‘Don’t tell me</p>
<p>that,’ and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness</p>
<p>condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.</p>
<p>And now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had</p>
<p>so long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for</p>
<p>it, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. They</p>
<p>salted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell</p>
<p>the skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On</p>
<p>the way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings,</p>
<p>and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. But as the</p>
<p>weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could</p>
<p>go no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. The</p>
<p>miller’s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: ‘Lay</p>
<p>yourself on the straw there,’ and gave him a slice of bread and cheese.</p>
<p>The peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman</p>
<p>thought: ‘He is tired and has gone to sleep.’ In the meantime came the</p>
<p>parson; the miller’s wife received him well, and said: ‘My husband is</p>
<p>out, so we will have a feast.’ The peasant listened, and when he heard</p>
<p>them talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make</p>
<p>shift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then the woman served up four</p>
<p>different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.</p>
<p>Just as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking</p>
<p>outside. The woman said: ‘Oh, heavens! It is my husband!’ she quickly</p>
<p>hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow,</p>
<p>the salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet</p>
<p>on the porch. Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: ‘Thank</p>
<p>heaven, you are back again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the</p>
<p>world were coming to an end.’ The miller saw the peasant lying on the</p>
<p>straw, and asked, ‘What is that fellow doing there?’ ‘Ah,’ said the</p>
<p>wife, ‘the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for</p>
<p>shelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where</p>
<p>the straw was.’ The man said: ‘I have no objection, but be quick and get</p>
<p>me something to eat.’ The woman said: ‘But I have nothing but bread and</p>
<p>cheese.’ ‘I am contented with anything,’ replied the husband, ‘so far as</p>
<p>I am concerned, bread and cheese will do,’ and looked at the peasant and</p>
<p>said: ‘Come and eat some more with me.’ The peasant did not require to</p>
<p>be invited twice, but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skin</p>
<p>in which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: ‘What have you</p>
<p>there?’ The peasant answered: ‘I have a soothsayer inside it.’ ‘Can</p>
<p>he foretell anything to me?’ said the miller. ‘Why not?’ answered</p>
<p>the peasant: ‘but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to</p>
<p>himself.’ The miller was curious, and said: ‘Let him foretell something</p>
<p>for once.’ Then the peasant pinched the raven’s head, so that he croaked</p>
<p>and made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said: ‘What did he say?’ The</p>
<p>peasant answered: ‘In the first place, he says that there is some wine</p>
<p>hidden under the pillow.’ ‘Bless me!’ cried the miller, and went there</p>
<p>and found the wine. ‘Now go on,’ said he. The peasant made the raven</p>
<p>croak again, and said: ‘In the second place, he says that there is some</p>
<p>roast meat in the tiled stove.’ ‘Upon my word!’ cried the miller, and</p>
<p>went thither, and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven</p>
<p>prophesy still more, and said: ‘Thirdly, he says that there is some</p>
<p>salad on the bed.’ ‘That would be a fine thing!’ cried the miller, and</p>
<p>went there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven</p>
<p>once more till he croaked, and said: ‘Fourthly, he says that there</p>
<p>are some cakes under the bed.’ ‘That would be a fine thing!’ cried the</p>
<p>miller, and looked there, and found the cakes.</p>
<p>And now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller’s wife</p>
<p>was frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with</p>
<p>her. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little</p>
<p>peasant said: ‘First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth</p>
<p>is something bad.’ So they ate, and after that they bargained how much</p>
<p>the miller was to give for the fifth prophecy, until they agreed on</p>
<p>three hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched the raven’s</p>
<p>head till he croaked loudly. The miller asked: ‘What did he say?’ The</p>
<p>peasant replied: ‘He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in</p>
<p>the closet on the porch.’ The miller said: ‘The Devil must go out,’ and</p>
<p>opened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys,</p>
<p>and the peasant unlocked the closet. The parson ran out as fast as he</p>
<p>could, and the miller said: ‘It was true; I saw the black rascal with my</p>
<p>own eyes.’ The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with</p>
<p>the three hundred talers.</p>
<p>At home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful</p>
<p>house, and the peasants said: ‘The small peasant has certainly been to</p>
<p>the place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in</p>
<p>shovels.’ Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and</p>
<p>bidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered: ‘I sold my cow’s</p>
<p>skin in the town, for three hundred talers.’ When the peasants heard</p>
<p>that, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed</p>
<p>all their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in</p>
<p>the town to the greatest advantage. The mayor, however, said: ‘But my</p>
<p>servant must go first.’ When she came to the merchant in the town, he</p>
<p>did not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others</p>
<p>came, he did not give them so much, and said: ‘What can I do with all</p>
<p>these skins?’</p>
<p>Then the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus</p>
<p>outwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this</p>
<p>treachery before the mayor. The innocent little peasant was unanimously</p>
<p>sentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel</p>
<p>pierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest was brought who</p>
<p>was to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire to</p>
<p>a distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the</p>
<p>man who had been with the miller’s wife. He said to him: ‘I set you free</p>
<p>from the closet, set me free from the barrel.’ At this same moment up</p>
<p>came, with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had</p>
<p>long been wishing to be mayor, so he cried with all his might: ‘No, I</p>
<p>will not do it; if the whole world insists on it, I will not do it!’ The</p>
<p>shepherd hearing that, came up to him, and asked: ‘What are you about?</p>
<p>What is it that you will not do?’ The peasant said: ‘They want to make</p>
<p>me mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.’</p>
<p>The shepherd said: ‘If nothing more than that is needful in order to be</p>
<p>mayor, I would get into the barrel at once.’ The peasant said: ‘If you</p>
<p>will get in, you will be mayor.’ The shepherd was willing, and got in,</p>
<p>and the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd’s</p>
<p>flock for himself, and drove it away. The parson went to the crowd,</p>
<p>and declared that the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the</p>
<p>barrel towards the water. When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd</p>
<p>cried: ‘I am quite willing to be mayor.’ They believed no otherwise than</p>
<p>that it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered: ‘That is</p>
<p>what we intend, but first you shall look about you a little down below</p>
<p>there,’ and they rolled the barrel down into the water.</p>
<p>After that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the</p>
<p>village, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of</p>
<p>sheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished,</p>
<p>and said: ‘Peasant, from whence do you come? Have you come out of the</p>
<p>water?’ ‘Yes, truly,’ replied the peasant, ‘I sank deep, deep down,</p>
<p>until at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the</p>
<p>barrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number</p>
<p>of lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with</p>
<p>me.’ Said the peasants: ‘Are there any more there?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ said he,</p>
<p>‘more than I could want.’ Then the peasants made up their minds that</p>
<p>they too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the</p>
<p>mayor said: ‘I come first.’ So they went to the water together, and just</p>
<p>then there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which</p>
<p>are called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon</p>
<p>the peasants cried: ‘We already see the sheep down below!’ The mayor</p>
<p>pressed forward and said: ‘I will go down first, and look about me, and</p>
<p>if things promise well I’ll call you.’ So he jumped in; splash! went</p>
<p>the water; it sounded as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd</p>
<p>plunged in after him as one man. Then the entire village was dead, and</p>
<p>the small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.</p>
