            <p>There was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was</p>
<p>Catherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said.</p>
<p>‘Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be</p>
<p>hungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.’</p>
<p>‘Very well,’ said she, ‘it shall all be ready.’ When dinner-time drew</p>
<p>nigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and</p>
<p>put it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to</p>
<p>crackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it:</p>
<p>then she said to herself, ‘The steak is almost ready, I may as well go</p>
<p>to the cellar for the ale.’ So she left the pan on the fire and took a</p>
<p>large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran</p>
<p>into the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her</p>
<p>head, ‘The dog is not shut up--he may be running away with the steak;</p>
<p>that’s well thought of.’ So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough</p>
<p>the rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Away ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran</p>
<p>faster than she, and stuck close to the steak. ‘It’s all gone, and “what</p>
<p>can’t be cured must be endured”,’ said Catherine. So she turned round;</p>
<p>and as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely</p>
<p>to cool herself.</p>
<p>Now all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned</p>
<p>the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till</p>
<p>the cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had</p>
<p>happened. ‘My stars!’ said she, ‘what shall I do to keep Frederick from</p>
<p>seeing all this slopping about?’ So she thought a while; and at last</p>
<p>remembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair,</p>
<p>and that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale</p>
<p>nicely. ‘What a lucky thing,’ said she, ‘that we kept that meal! we have</p>
<p>now a good use for it.’ So away she went for it: but she managed to set</p>
<p>it down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus</p>
<p>all the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. ‘Ah!</p>
<p>well,’ said she, ‘when one goes another may as well follow.’ Then she</p>
<p>strewed the meal all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her</p>
<p>cleverness, and said, ‘How very neat and clean it looks!’</p>
<p>At noon Frederick came home. ‘Now, wife,’ cried he, ‘what have you for</p>
<p>dinner?’ ‘O Frederick!’ answered she, ‘I was cooking you a steak; but</p>
<p>while I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while</p>
<p>I ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale</p>
<p>with the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the</p>
<p>cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!’ ‘Kate, Kate,’ said he,</p>
<p>‘how could you do all this?’ Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the</p>
<p>ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?’ ‘Why, Frederick,’ said she, ‘I</p>
<p>did not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.’</p>
<p>The husband thought to himself, ‘If my wife manages matters thus, I must</p>
<p>look sharp myself.’ Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he</p>
<p>said to Catherine, ‘What pretty yellow buttons these are! I shall put</p>
<p>them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you</p>
<p>never go near or meddle with them.’ ‘No, Frederick,’ said she, ‘that</p>
<p>I never will.’ As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with</p>
<p>earthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy.</p>
<p>‘Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if</p>
<p>you had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with you.’ ‘Yellow</p>
<p>buttons!’ said they: ‘let us have a look at them.’ ‘Go into the garden</p>
<p>and dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow buttons: I dare</p>
<p>not go myself.’ So the rogues went: and when they found what these</p>
<p>yellow buttons were, they took them all away, and left her plenty of</p>
<p>plates and dishes. Then she set them all about the house for a show:</p>
<p>and when Frederick came back, he cried out, ‘Kate, what have you been</p>
<p>doing?’ ‘See,’ said she, ‘I have bought all these with your yellow</p>
<p>buttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves</p>
<p>and dug them up.’ ‘Wife, wife,’ said Frederick, ‘what a pretty piece of</p>
<p>work you have made! those yellow buttons were all my money: how came you</p>
<p>to do such a thing?’ ‘Why,’ answered she, ‘I did not know there was any</p>
<p>harm in it; you should have told me.’</p>
<p>Catherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband,</p>
<p>‘Hark ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after</p>
<p>the thieves.’ ‘Well, we will try,’ answered he; ‘but take some butter</p>
<p>and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.’</p>
<p>‘Very well,’ said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the</p>
<p>fastest, he left his wife some way behind. ‘It does not matter,’ thought</p>
<p>she: ‘when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.’</p>
<p>Presently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there</p>
<p>was a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees</p>
<p>on each side as they passed. ‘Ah, see now,’ said she, ‘how they have</p>
<p>bruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.’ So she</p>
<p>took pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so</p>
<p>that the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this</p>
<p>kind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down</p>
<p>the hill. Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she</p>
<p>said, ‘Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he</p>
<p>has younger legs than I have.’ Then she rolled the other cheese after</p>
<p>it; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill. But she said</p>
<p>she supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she</p>
<p>could not stay there all day waiting for them.</p>
<p>At last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to</p>
<p>eat. Then she gave him the dry bread. ‘Where are the butter and cheese?’</p>
<p>said he. ‘Oh!’ answered she, ‘I used the butter to grease those poor</p>
<p>trees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I</p>
<p>sent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on</p>
<p>the road together somewhere.’ ‘What a goose you are to do such silly</p>
<p>things!’ said the husband. ‘How can you say so?’ said she; ‘I am sure</p>
<p>you never told me not.’</p>
<p>They ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, ‘Kate, I hope you</p>
<p>locked the door safe when you came away.’ ‘No,’ answered she, ‘you did</p>
<p>not tell me.’ ‘Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,’</p>
<p>said Frederick, ‘and bring with you something to eat.’</p>
<p>Catherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way,</p>
<p>‘Frederick wants something to eat; but I don’t think he is very fond of</p>
<p>butter and cheese: I’ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar,</p>
<p>for I have often seen him take some.’</p>
<p>When she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she</p>
<p>took off the hinges, and said, ‘Frederick told me to lock the door, but</p>
<p>surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.’ So she took</p>
<p>her time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried</p>
<p>out, ‘There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as</p>
<p>carefully as you please.’ ‘Alas! alas!’ said he, ‘what a clever wife I</p>
<p>have! I sent you to make the house fast, and you take the door away, so</p>
<p>that everybody may go in and out as they please--however, as you have</p>
<p>brought the door, you shall carry it about with you for your pains.’</p>
<p>‘Very well,’ answered she, ‘I’ll carry the door; but I’ll not carry the</p>
<p>nuts and vinegar bottle also--that would be too much of a load; so if</p>
<p>you please, I’ll fasten them to the door.’</p>
<p>Frederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off</p>
<p>into the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and</p>
<p>when it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there.</p>
<p>Scarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they</p>
<p>were looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that</p>
<p>class of people who find things before they are lost; they were tired;</p>
<p>so they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and</p>
<p>Catherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up</p>
<p>some stones. Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on</p>
<p>the head with them: but they only said, ‘It must be near morning, for</p>
<p>the wind shakes the fir-apples down.’</p>
<p>Catherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired;</p>
<p>but she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said</p>
<p>softly, ‘Frederick, I must let the nuts go.’ ‘No,’ answered he, ‘not</p>
<p>now, they will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that: they must go.’ ‘Well,</p>
<p>then, make haste and throw them down, if you will.’ Then away rattled</p>
<p>the nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried, ‘Bless me,</p>
<p>it is hailing.’</p>
<p>A little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy:</p>
<p>so she whispered to Frederick, ‘I must throw the vinegar down.’ ‘Pray</p>
<p>don’t,’ answered he, ‘it will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that,’ said</p>
<p>she, ‘go it must.’ So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves</p>
<p>said, ‘What a heavy dew there is!’</p>
<p>At last it popped into Catherine’s head that it was the door itself that</p>
<p>was so heavy all the time: so she whispered, ‘Frederick, I must throw</p>
<p>the door down soon.’ But he begged and prayed her not to do so, for he</p>
<p>was sure it would betray them. ‘Here goes, however,’ said she: and down</p>
<p>went the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they cried</p>
<p>out ‘Murder!’ and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast as they</p>
<p>could, and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came down,</p>
<p>there they found all their money safe and sound.</p>
