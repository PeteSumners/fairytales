        <div class="story-content">
            <p>The wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew</p>
<p>nigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, ‘Always be</p>
<p>a good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.’ Soon</p>
<p>afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden;</p>
<p>and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always</p>
<p>good and kind to all about her. And the snow fell and spread a beautiful</p>
<p>white covering over the grave; but by the time the spring came, and the</p>
<p>sun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife. This</p>
<p>new wife had two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her;</p>
<p>they were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time</p>
<p>for the poor little girl. ‘What does the good-for-nothing want in the</p>
<p>parlour?’ said they; ‘they who would eat bread should first earn it;</p>
<p>away with the kitchen-maid!’ Then they took away her fine clothes, and</p>
<p>gave her an old grey frock to put on, and laughed at her, and turned her</p>
<p>into the kitchen.</p>
<p>There she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight, to</p>
<p>bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. Besides that,</p>
<p>the sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed at her. In the</p>
<p>evening when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on, but was made</p>
<p>to lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of course, made her</p>
<p>always dusty and dirty, they called her Ashputtel.</p>
<p>It happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his</p>
<p>wife’s daughters what he should bring them. ‘Fine clothes,’ said the</p>
<p>first; ‘Pearls and diamonds,’ cried the second. ‘Now, child,’ said he</p>
<p>to his own daughter, ‘what will you have?’ ‘The first twig, dear</p>
<p>father, that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come</p>
<p>homewards,’ said she. Then he bought for the first two the fine clothes</p>
<p>and pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he</p>
<p>rode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against him, and almost</p>
<p>pushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he</p>
<p>got home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it, and went to</p>
<p>her mother’s grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was</p>
<p>watered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree. Three</p>
<p>times every day she went to it and cried; and soon a little bird came</p>
<p>and built its nest upon the tree, and talked with her, and watched over</p>
<p>her, and brought her whatever she wished for.</p>
<p>Now it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to</p>
<p>last three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose</p>
<p>a bride for himself. Ashputtel’s two sisters were asked to come; so they</p>
<p>called her up, and said, ‘Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie</p>
<p>our sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king’s feast.’</p>
<p>Then she did as she was told; but when all was done she could not help</p>
<p>crying, for she thought to herself, she should so have liked to have</p>
<p>gone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard</p>
<p>to let her go. ‘You, Ashputtel!’ said she; ‘you who have nothing to</p>
<p>wear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance--you want to go to</p>
<p>the ball? And when she kept on begging, she said at last, to get rid of</p>
<p>her, ‘I will throw this dishful of peas into the ash-heap, and if in</p>
<p>two hours’ time you have picked them all out, you shall go to the feast</p>
<p>too.’</p>
<p>Then she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden ran</p>
<p>out at the back door into the garden, and cried out:</p>
<p>‘Hither, hither, through the sky,</p>
<p>Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!</p>
<p>Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,</p>
<p>Hither, hither, haste away!</p>
<p>One and all come help me, quick!</p>
<p>Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!’</p>
<p>Then first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window; next</p>
<p>came two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under</p>
<p>heaven, chirping and fluttering in: and they flew down into the ashes.</p>
<p>And the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick,</p>
<p>pick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick: and among</p>
<p>them all they soon picked out all the good grain, and put it into a dish</p>
<p>but left the ashes. Long before the end of the hour the work was quite</p>
<p>done, and all flew out again at the windows.</p>
<p>Then Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought</p>
<p>that now she should go to the ball. But the mother said, ‘No, no! you</p>
<p>slut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go.’ And when</p>
<p>Ashputtel begged very hard to go, she said, ‘If you can in one hour’s</p>
<p>time pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes, you shall go</p>
<p>too.’ And thus she thought she should at least get rid of her. So she</p>
<p>shook two dishes of peas into the ashes.</p>
<p>But the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house,</p>
<p>and cried out as before:</p>
<p>‘Hither, hither, through the sky,</p>
<p>Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!</p>
<p>Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,</p>
<p>Hither, hither, haste away!</p>
<p>One and all come help me, quick!</p>
<p>Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!’</p>
<p>Then first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came two</p>
<p>turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven,</p>
<p>chirping and hopping about. And they flew down into the ashes; and the</p>
<p>little doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and</p>
<p>then the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put all the good grain</p>
<p>into the dishes, and left all the ashes. Before half an hour’s time all</p>
<p>was done, and out they flew again. And then Ashputtel took the dishes to</p>
<p>her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball.</p>
<p>But her mother said, ‘It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no</p>
<p>clothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame’: and off</p>
<p>she went with her two daughters to the ball.</p>
<p>Now when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went</p>
<p>sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:</p>
<p>‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,</p>
<p>Gold and silver over me!’</p>
<p>Then her friend the bird flew out of the tree, and brought a gold and</p>
<p>silver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them</p>
<p>on, and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know her,</p>
<p>and thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine and</p>
<p>beautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of Ashputtel,</p>
<p>taking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt.</p>
<p>The king’s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced</p>
<p>with her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when anyone</p>
<p>else came to ask her to dance, he said, ‘This lady is dancing with me.’</p>
<p>Thus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to</p>
<p>go home: and the king’s son said, ‘I shall go and take care of you to</p>
<p>your home’; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived. But</p>
<p>she slipped away from him, unawares, and ran off towards home; and as</p>
<p>the prince followed her, she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut</p>
<p>the door. Then he waited till her father came home, and told him that</p>
<p>the unknown maiden, who had been at the feast, had hid herself in the</p>
<p>pigeon-house. But when they had broken open the door they found no one</p>
<p>within; and as they came back into the house, Ashputtel was lying, as</p>
<p>she always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little</p>
<p>lamp was burning in the chimney. For she had run as quickly as she could</p>
<p>through the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there taken</p>
<p>off her beautiful clothes, and put them beneath the tree, that the bird</p>
<p>might carry them away, and had lain down again amid the ashes in her</p>
<p>little grey frock.</p>
<p>The next day when the feast was again held, and her father, mother, and</p>
<p>sisters were gone, Ashputtel went to the hazel-tree, and said:</p>
<p>‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,</p>
<p>Gold and silver over me!’</p>
<p>And the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she</p>
<p>had worn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball, everyone</p>
<p>wondered at her beauty: but the king’s son, who was waiting for her,</p>
<p>took her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone asked her to</p>
<p>dance, he said as before, ‘This lady is dancing with me.’</p>
<p>When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son followed here</p>
<p>as before, that he might see into what house she went: but she sprang</p>
<p>away from him all at once into the garden behind her father’s house.</p>
<p>In this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and</p>
<p>Ashputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without</p>
<p>being seen. Then the king’s son lost sight of her, and could not find</p>
<p>out where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said</p>
<p>to him, ‘The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I</p>
<p>think she must have sprung into the pear-tree.’ The father thought to</p>
<p>himself, ‘Can it be Ashputtel?’ So he had an axe brought; and they cut</p>
<p>down the tree, but found no one upon it. And when they came back into</p>
<p>the kitchen, there lay Ashputtel among the ashes; for she had slipped</p>
<p>down on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful clothes</p>
<p>back to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on her little grey</p>
<p>frock.</p>
<p>The third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone, she</p>
<p>went again into the garden, and said:</p>
<p>‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,</p>
<p>Gold and silver over me!’</p>
<p>Then her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the</p>
<p>former one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she came</p>
<p>to the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and the</p>
<p>king’s son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked her to</p>
<p>dance, he said, ‘This lady is _my_ partner, sir.’</p>
<p>When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son would go with</p>
<p>her, and said to himself, ‘I will not lose her this time’; but, however,</p>
<p>she again slipped away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped</p>
<p>her left golden slipper upon the stairs.</p>
<p>The prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his father,</p>
<p>and said, ‘I will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipper</p>
<p>fits.’ Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they</p>
<p>had beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden</p>
<p>slipper. The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was, and</p>
<p>wanted to try it on, and the mother stood by. But her great toe could</p>
<p>not go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her. Then</p>
<p>the mother gave her a knife, and said, ‘Never mind, cut it off; when you</p>
<p>are queen you will not care about toes; you will not want to walk.’ So</p>
<p>the silly girl cut off her great toe, and thus squeezed on the shoe,</p>
<p>and went to the king’s son. Then he took her for his bride, and set her</p>
<p>beside him on his horse, and rode away with her homewards.</p>
<p>But on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that Ashputtel</p>
<p>had planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:</p>
<p>‘Back again! back again! look to the shoe!</p>
<p>The shoe is too small, and not made for you!</p>
<p>Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,</p>
<p>For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’</p>
<p>Then the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the</p>
<p>blood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him. So he</p>
<p>turned his horse round, and brought the false bride back to her home,</p>
<p>and said, ‘This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put</p>
<p>on the slipper.’ Then she went into the room and got her foot into the</p>
<p>shoe, all but the heel, which was too large. But her mother squeezed it</p>
<p>in till the blood came, and took her to the king’s son: and he set her</p>
<p>as his bride by his side on his horse, and rode away with her.</p>
<p>But when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still,</p>
<p>and sang:</p>
<p>‘Back again! back again! look to the shoe!</p>
<p>The shoe is too small, and not made for you!</p>
<p>Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,</p>
<p>For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’</p>
<p>Then he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the</p>
<p>shoe, that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horse</p>
<p>and brought her also back again. ‘This is not the true bride,’ said he</p>
<p>to the father; ‘have you no other daughters?’ ‘No,’ said he; ‘there is</p>
<p>only a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am</p>
<p>sure she cannot be the bride.’ The prince told him to send her. But the</p>
<p>mother said, ‘No, no, she is much too dirty; she will not dare to show</p>
<p>herself.’ However, the prince would have her come; and she first washed</p>
<p>her face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and he reached</p>
<p>her the golden slipper. Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot,</p>
<p>and put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made</p>
<p>for her. And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and</p>
<p>said, ‘This is the right bride.’ But the mother and both the sisters</p>
<p>were frightened, and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on his</p>
<p>horse, and rode away with her. And when they came to the hazel-tree, the</p>
<p>white dove sang:</p>
<p>‘Home! home! look at the shoe!</p>
<p>Princess! the shoe was made for you!</p>
<p>Prince! prince! take home thy bride,</p>
<p>For she is the true one that sits by thy side!’</p>
<p>And when the dove had done its song, it came flying, and perched upon</p>
<p>her right shoulder, and so went home with her.</p>
