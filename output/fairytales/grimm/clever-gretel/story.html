        <div class="story-content">
            <p>There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and</p>
<p>when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that,</p>
<p>was quite happy and thought: ‘You certainly are a pretty girl!’ And when</p>
<p>she came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine,</p>
<p>and as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she</p>
<p>was cooking until she was satisfied, and said: ‘The cook must know what</p>
<p>the food is like.’</p>
<p>It came to pass that the master one day said to her: ‘Gretel, there is a</p>
<p>guest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.’ ‘I will</p>
<p>see to it, master,’ answered Gretel. She killed two fowls, scalded them,</p>
<p>plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before</p>
<p>the fire, that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown, and were</p>
<p>nearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called out</p>
<p>to her master: ‘If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away</p>
<p>from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten</p>
<p>the moment they are at their juiciest.’ The master said: ‘I will run</p>
<p>myself, and fetch the guest.’ When the master had turned his back,</p>
<p>Gretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: ‘Standing</p>
<p>so long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows</p>
<p>when they will come? Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a</p>
<p>drink.’ She ran down, set a jug, said: ‘God bless it for you, Gretel,’</p>
<p>and took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should</p>
<p>not be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.</p>
<p>Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them,</p>
<p>and drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good,</p>
<p>Gretel thought: ‘Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!’</p>
<p>She touched it with her finger, and said: ‘Ah! how good fowls are! It</p>
<p>certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right</p>
<p>time!’ She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with</p>
<p>his guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought:</p>
<p>‘One of the wings is burning! I had better take it off and eat it.’</p>
<p>So she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she</p>
<p>thought: ‘The other must go down too, or else master will observe that</p>
<p>something is missing.’ When the two wings were eaten, she went and</p>
<p>looked for her master, and did not see him. It suddenly occurred to</p>
<p>her: ‘Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in</p>
<p>somewhere.’ Then she said: ‘Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has</p>
<p>been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is</p>
<p>eaten you will have some peace, why should God’s good gifts be spoilt?’</p>
<p>So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the</p>
<p>one chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed down,</p>
<p>and still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said:</p>
<p>‘What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what’s</p>
<p>right for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take</p>
<p>another draught it would do me no harm.’ So she took another hearty</p>
<p>drink, and let the second chicken follow the first.</p>
<p>While she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: ‘Hurry</p>
<p>up, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!’ ‘Yes, sir, I will</p>
<p>soon serve up,’ answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to see that</p>
<p>the table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was</p>
<p>going to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps. Presently</p>
<p>the guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door.</p>
<p>Gretel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest,</p>
<p>she put her finger to her lips and said: ‘Hush! hush! go away as quickly</p>
<p>as you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he</p>
<p>certainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your</p>
<p>two ears. Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!’ The guest</p>
<p>heard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he</p>
<p>could. Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried:</p>
<p>‘You have invited a fine guest!’ ‘Why, Gretel? What do you mean by</p>
<p>that?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘he has taken the chickens which I was just</p>
<p>going to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!’ ‘That’s a</p>
<p>nice trick!’ said her master, and lamented the fine chickens. ‘If he had</p>
<p>but left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.’ He called to</p>
<p>him to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him</p>
<p>with the knife still in his hand, crying: ‘Just one, just one,’ meaning</p>
<p>that the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both. The</p>
<p>guest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of</p>
<p>his ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take</p>
<p>them both with him.</p>
