            <p>There were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich and</p>
<p>the other poor. The poor man thought he would try to better himself; so,</p>
<p>pulling off his red coat, he became a gardener, and dug his ground well,</p>
<p>and sowed turnips.</p>
<p>When the seed came up, there was one plant bigger than all the rest; and</p>
<p>it kept getting larger and larger, and seemed as if it would never cease</p>
<p>growing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for</p>
<p>there never was such a one seen before, and never will again. At last it</p>
<p>was so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly draw it; and</p>
<p>the gardener knew not what in the world to do with it, nor whether it</p>
<p>would be a blessing or a curse to him. One day he said to himself, ‘What</p>
<p>shall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another;</p>
<p>and for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing</p>
<p>perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.’</p>
<p>Then he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave it</p>
<p>to the king. ‘What a wonderful thing!’ said the king; ‘I have seen many</p>
<p>strange things, but such a monster as this I never saw. Where did you</p>
<p>get the seed? or is it only your good luck? If so, you are a true child</p>
<p>of fortune.’ ‘Ah, no!’ answered the gardener, ‘I am no child of fortune;</p>
<p>I am a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so I</p>
<p>laid aside my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground. I have a</p>
<p>brother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world</p>
<p>knows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me.’</p>
<p>The king then took pity on him, and said, ‘You shall be poor no</p>
<p>longer. I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your</p>
<p>brother.’ Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so</p>
<p>rich that his brother’s fortune could not at all be compared with his.</p>
<p>When the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the</p>
<p>gardener so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he</p>
<p>could contrive to get the same good fortune for himself. However, he</p>
<p>determined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together a</p>
<p>rich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must</p>
<p>have a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so</p>
<p>much for only a turnip, what must his present be worth?</p>
<p>The king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to</p>
<p>give in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so</p>
<p>the soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him.</p>
<p>When he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite;</p>
<p>and at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to</p>
<p>kill his brother.</p>
<p>So he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to</p>
<p>lie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, ‘Dear brother, I have</p>
<p>found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between</p>
<p>us.’ The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out</p>
<p>together, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed out</p>
<p>upon him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree.</p>
<p>But whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a</p>
<p>horse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their</p>
<p>prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a</p>
<p>cord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away. Meantime</p>
<p>he worked and worked away, till he made a hole large enough to put out</p>
<p>his head.</p>
<p>When the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow,</p>
<p>who was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went. As soon as</p>
<p>the man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out, ‘Good</p>
<p>morning! good morning to thee, my friend!’ The student looked about</p>
<p>everywhere; and seeing no one, and not knowing where the voice came</p>
<p>from, cried out, ‘Who calls me?’</p>
<p>Then the man in the tree answered, ‘Lift up thine eyes, for behold here</p>
<p>I sit in the sack of wisdom; here have I, in a short time, learned great</p>
<p>and wondrous things. Compared to this seat, all the learning of the</p>
<p>schools is as empty air. A little longer, and I shall know all that man</p>
<p>can know, and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind. Here</p>
<p>I discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws</p>
<p>that control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the</p>
<p>healing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of</p>
<p>precious stones. Wert thou but once here, my friend, though wouldst feel</p>
<p>and own the power of knowledge.</p>
<p>The student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said,</p>
<p>‘Blessed be the day and hour when I found you; cannot you contrive to</p>
<p>let me into the sack for a little while?’ Then the other answered, as if</p>
<p>very unwillingly, ‘A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou</p>
<p>wilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an</p>
<p>hour below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown</p>
<p>to me.’</p>
<p>So the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung</p>
<p>heavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith,</p>
<p>for his thirst for knowledge was great. Then the other pretended to give</p>
<p>way, and said, ‘Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend, by untying</p>
<p>yonder cord, and then thou shalt enter.’ So the student let him down,</p>
<p>opened the sack, and set him free. ‘Now then,’ cried he, ‘let me ascend</p>
<p>quickly.’ As he began to put himself into the sack heels first, ‘Wait a</p>
<p>while,’ said the gardener, ‘that is not the way.’ Then he pushed him</p>
<p>in head first, tied up the sack, and soon swung up the searcher after</p>
<p>wisdom dangling in the air. ‘How is it with thee, friend?’ said he,</p>
<p>‘dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee? Rest there in peace,</p>
<p>till thou art a wiser man than thou wert.’</p>
<p>So saying, he trotted off on the student’s nag, and left the poor fellow</p>
<p>to gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down.</p>
