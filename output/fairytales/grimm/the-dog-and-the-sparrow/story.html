            <p>A shepherd’s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him</p>
<p>suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he</p>
<p>took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.</p>
<p>On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, ‘Why are you so sad,</p>
<p>my friend?’ ‘Because,’ said the dog, ‘I am very very hungry, and have</p>
<p>nothing to eat.’ ‘If that be all,’ answered the sparrow, ‘come with me</p>
<p>into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.’ So on they</p>
<p>went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher’s shop,</p>
<p>the sparrow said to the dog, ‘Stand there a little while till I peck you</p>
<p>down a piece of meat.’ So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having</p>
<p>first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she</p>
<p>pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf,</p>
<p>till at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled</p>
<p>away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. ‘Well,’ said</p>
<p>the sparrow, ‘you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to</p>
<p>the next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.’ When the dog had</p>
<p>eaten this too, the sparrow said to him, ‘Well, my good friend, have you</p>
<p>had enough now?’ ‘I have had plenty of meat,’ answered he, ‘but I should</p>
<p>like to have a piece of bread to eat after it.’ ‘Come with me then,’</p>
<p>said the sparrow, ‘and you shall soon have that too.’ So she took him</p>
<p>to a baker’s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till</p>
<p>they fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to</p>
<p>another shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the</p>
<p>sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. ‘Yes,’ said he; ‘and</p>
<p>now let us take a walk a little way out of the town.’ So they both went</p>
<p>out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone</p>
<p>far before the dog said, ‘I am very much tired--I should like to take a</p>
<p>nap.’ ‘Very well,’ answered the sparrow, ‘do so, and in the meantime</p>
<p>I will perch upon that bush.’ So the dog stretched himself out on the</p>
<p>road, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with</p>
<p>a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The</p>
<p>sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would</p>
<p>go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called</p>
<p>out, ‘Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.’ But the</p>
<p>carter, grumbling to himself, ‘You make it the worse for me, indeed!</p>
<p>what can you do?’ cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor</p>
<p>dog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. ‘There,’ cried the</p>
<p>sparrow, ‘thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now</p>
<p>mind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.’</p>
<p>‘Do your worst, and welcome,’ said the brute, ‘what harm can you do me?’</p>
<p>and passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and</p>
<p>pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then</p>
<p>all the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked</p>
<p>round, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty.</p>
<p>‘What an unlucky wretch I am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said</p>
<p>the sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and</p>
<p>pecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this,</p>
<p>he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill</p>
<p>her; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse’s head</p>
<p>with such force, that he fell down dead. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’</p>
<p>cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow. And as the carter</p>
<p>went on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the</p>
<p>cart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine</p>
<p>ran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, ‘Miserable wretch</p>
<p>that I am!’ But the sparrow answered, ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ and</p>
<p>perched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The</p>
<p>carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she</p>
<p>flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the</p>
<p>spot. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ said he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said</p>
<p>the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him</p>
<p>too. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or</p>
<p>caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his</p>
<p>third horse as he done the other two. ‘Alas! miserable wretch that I</p>
<p>am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ answered the sparrow as she flew</p>
<p>away; ‘now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.’ The</p>
<p>carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home</p>
<p>overflowing with rage and vexation. ‘Alas!’ said he to his wife, ‘what</p>
<p>ill luck has befallen me!--my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three</p>
<p>dead.’ ‘Alas! husband,’ replied she, ‘and a wicked bird has come into</p>
<p>the house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am</p>
<p>sure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it</p>
<p>up at such a rate!’ Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of</p>
<p>birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the</p>
<p>midst of them. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ cried the carter; for he saw</p>
<p>that the corn was almost all gone. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the</p>
<p>sparrow; ‘thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!’ and away she flew.</p>
<p>The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down</p>
<p>into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat</p>
<p>himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat</p>
<p>on the outside of the window, and cried ‘Carter! thy cruelty shall cost</p>
<p>thee thy life!’ With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet,</p>
<p>and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the</p>
<p>window. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and</p>
<p>cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!’ Then he became mad and</p>
<p>blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he</p>
<p>cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter</p>
<p>and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture,</p>
<p>glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without</p>
<p>touching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the</p>
<p>wife said, ‘Shall I kill her at once?’ ‘No,’ cried he, ‘that is letting</p>
<p>her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat</p>
<p>her.’ But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck</p>
<p>and cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!’ With that he</p>
<p>could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, ‘Wife,</p>
<p>strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.’ And the wife struck; but</p>
<p>she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down</p>
<p>dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.</p>
