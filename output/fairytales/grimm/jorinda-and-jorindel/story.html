            <p>There was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy</p>
<p>wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take</p>
<p>any shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of</p>
<p>an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always</p>
<p>became an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred</p>
<p>paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step</p>
<p>till she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given</p>
<p>her his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came</p>
<p>within that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her</p>
<p>into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were</p>
<p>seven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle, and all with</p>
<p>beautiful birds in them.</p>
<p>Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier</p>
<p>than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd</p>
<p>lad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon</p>
<p>to be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be</p>
<p>alone; and Jorindel said, ‘We must take care that we don’t go too near</p>
<p>to the fairy’s castle.’ It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the</p>
<p>setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon</p>
<p>the green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall</p>
<p>birches.</p>
<p>Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and</p>
<p>both felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be</p>
<p>parted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when</p>
<p>they looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves</p>
<p>at a loss to know what path to take.</p>
<p>The sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind</p>
<p>the hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the</p>
<p>bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old</p>
<p>walls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled.</p>
<p>Jorinda was just singing,</p>
<p>‘The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,</p>
<p>Well-a-day! Well-a-day!</p>
<p>He mourn’d for the fate of his darling mate,</p>
<p>Well-a-day!’</p>
<p>when her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and</p>
<p>beheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended</p>
<p>with a mournful _jug, jug_. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times</p>
<p>round them, and three times screamed:</p>
<p>‘Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!’</p>
<p>Jorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither</p>
<p>weep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down;</p>
<p>the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the</p>
<p>old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and</p>
<p>chin that almost met one another.</p>
<p>She mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away</p>
<p>with it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone--but</p>
<p>what could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the spot</p>
<p>where he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse</p>
<p>voice:</p>
<p>‘Till the prisoner is fast,</p>
<p>And her doom is cast,</p>
<p>There stay! Oh, stay!</p>
<p>When the charm is around her,</p>
<p>And the spell has bound her,</p>
<p>Hie away! away!’</p>
<p>On a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees</p>
<p>before the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but</p>
<p>she laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she</p>
<p>went her way.</p>
<p>He prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. ‘Alas!’ he said, ‘what</p>
<p>will become of me?’ He could not go back to his own home, so he went to</p>
<p>a strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time</p>
<p>did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go,</p>
<p>but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.</p>
<p>At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower,</p>
<p>and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he</p>
<p>plucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and</p>
<p>that everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he</p>
<p>found his Jorinda again.</p>
<p>In the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for</p>
<p>this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but</p>
<p>on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple</p>
<p>flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly</p>
<p>pearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and</p>
<p>night, till he came again to the castle.</p>
<p>He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become</p>
<p>fixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door.</p>
<p>Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with</p>
<p>the flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court,</p>
<p>and listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the</p>
<p>chamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in</p>
<p>the seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and</p>
<p>screamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for</p>
<p>the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at</p>
<p>the birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then</p>
<p>should he find out which was his Jorinda? While he was thinking what to</p>
<p>do, he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the</p>
<p>best of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her, touched</p>
<p>the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her</p>
<p>arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when</p>
<p>they walked together in the wood.</p>
<p>Then he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all</p>
<p>took their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were</p>
<p>married, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many</p>
<p>other lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy’s</p>
<p>cages by themselves, much longer than they liked.</p>
