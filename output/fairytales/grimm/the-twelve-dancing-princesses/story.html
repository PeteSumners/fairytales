        <div class="story-content">
            <p>There was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept in</p>
<p>twelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were</p>
<p>shut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite</p>
<p>worn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody</p>
<p>could find out how it happened, or where they had been.</p>
<p>Then the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could</p>
<p>discover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses</p>
<p>danced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his</p>
<p>wife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not</p>
<p>succeed, after three days and nights, should be put to death.</p>
<p>A king’s son soon came. He was well entertained, and in the evening was</p>
<p>taken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their</p>
<p>twelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance;</p>
<p>and, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door</p>
<p>of his chamber was left open. But the king’s son soon fell asleep; and</p>
<p>when he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been</p>
<p>dancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. The same thing</p>
<p>happened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be</p>
<p>cut off. After him came several others; but they had all the same luck,</p>
<p>and all lost their lives in the same manner.</p>
<p>Now it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle</p>
<p>and could fight no longer, passed through the country where this king</p>
<p>reigned: and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman,</p>
<p>who asked him where he was going. ‘I hardly know where I am going, or</p>
<p>what I had better do,’ said the soldier; ‘but I think I should like very</p>
<p>well to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time</p>
<p>I might be a king.’ ‘Well,’ said the old dame, ‘that is no very hard</p>
<p>task: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the</p>
<p>princesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves</p>
<p>you pretend to be fast asleep.’</p>
<p>Then she gave him a cloak, and said, ‘As soon as you put that on</p>
<p>you will become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the</p>
<p>princesses wherever they go.’ When the soldier heard all this good</p>
<p>counsel, he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and said</p>
<p>he was willing to undertake the task.</p>
<p>He was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered</p>
<p>fine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led</p>
<p>to the outer chamber. Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of</p>
<p>the princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all</p>
<p>away secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself</p>
<p>down on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if</p>
<p>he was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed</p>
<p>heartily; and the eldest said, ‘This fellow too might have done a wiser</p>
<p>thing than lose his life in this way!’ Then they rose up and opened</p>
<p>their drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and</p>
<p>dressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager</p>
<p>to begin dancing. But the youngest said, ‘I don’t know how it is, while</p>
<p>you are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some mischance will</p>
<p>befall us.’ ‘You simpleton,’ said the eldest, ‘you are always afraid;</p>
<p>have you forgotten how many kings’ sons have already watched in vain?</p>
<p>And as for this soldier, even if I had not given him his sleeping</p>
<p>draught, he would have slept soundly enough.’</p>
<p>When they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he</p>
<p>snored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were</p>
<p>quite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands,</p>
<p>and the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open. The soldier</p>
<p>saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest</p>
<p>leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put</p>
<p>on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them;</p>
<p>but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest</p>
<p>princess, and she cried out to her sisters, ‘All is not right; someone</p>
<p>took hold of my gown.’ ‘You silly creature!’ said the eldest, ‘it is</p>
<p>nothing but a nail in the wall.’ Then down they all went, and at the</p>
<p>bottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees; and</p>
<p>the leaves were all of silver, and glittered and sparkled beautifully.</p>
<p>The soldier wished to take away some token of the place; so he broke</p>
<p>off a little branch, and there came a loud noise from the tree. Then the</p>
<p>youngest daughter said again, ‘I am sure all is not right--did not you</p>
<p>hear that noise? That never happened before.’ But the eldest said, ‘It</p>
<p>is only our princes, who are shouting for joy at our approach.’</p>
<p>Then they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of</p>
<p>gold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering</p>
<p>diamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there</p>
<p>was a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but</p>
<p>the eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy.</p>
<p>So they went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the</p>
<p>lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them,</p>
<p>who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses.</p>
<p>One of the princesses went into each boat, and the soldier stepped into</p>
<p>the same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the lake, the</p>
<p>prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier</p>
<p>said, ‘I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing with all my might</p>
<p>we do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat</p>
<p>seems very heavy today.’ ‘It is only the heat of the weather,’ said the</p>
<p>princess: ‘I feel it very warm too.’</p>
<p>On the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from</p>
<p>which came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all landed,</p>
<p>and went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and</p>
<p>the soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and</p>
<p>when any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it</p>
<p>all up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty. At this,</p>
<p>too, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always</p>
<p>silenced her. They danced on till three o’clock in the morning, and then</p>
<p>all their shoes were worn out, so that they were obliged to leave off.</p>
<p>The princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the</p>
<p>soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the</p>
<p>opposite shore they took leave of each other, the princesses promising</p>
<p>to come again the next night.</p>
<p>When they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the princesses,</p>
<p>and laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very</p>
<p>much tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said, ‘Now all</p>
<p>is quite safe’; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine</p>
<p>clothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed. In the morning the</p>
<p>soldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more</p>
<p>of this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night;</p>
<p>and every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time</p>
<p>till their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home. However,</p>
<p>on the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a</p>
<p>token of where he had been.</p>
<p>As soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret, he was taken</p>
<p>before the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the</p>
<p>twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would</p>
<p>say. And when the king asked him. ‘Where do my twelve daughters dance at</p>
<p>night?’ he answered, ‘With twelve princes in a castle under ground.’ And</p>
<p>then he told the king all that had happened, and showed him the three</p>
<p>branches and the golden cup which he had brought with him. Then the king</p>
<p>called for the princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said</p>
<p>was true: and when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was</p>
<p>of no use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all. And the king</p>
<p>asked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife; and he</p>
<p>answered, ‘I am not very young, so I will have the eldest.’--And they</p>
<p>were married that very day, and the soldier was chosen to be the king’s</p>
<p>heir.</p>
