        <div class="story-content">
            <p>In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish</p>
<p>of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and</p>
<p>that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw.</p>
<p>When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her</p>
<p>observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards</p>
<p>a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw</p>
<p>began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?’ The coal</p>
<p>replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped</p>
<p>by sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been</p>
<p>burnt to ashes.’ The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin,</p>
<p>but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made</p>
<p>into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.’ ‘And would a better</p>
<p>fate have fallen to my lot?’ said the straw. ‘The old woman has</p>
<p>destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at</p>
<p>once, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.’</p>
<p>‘But what are we to do now?’ said the coal.</p>
<p>‘I think,’ answered the bean, ‘that as we have so fortunately escaped</p>
<p>death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new</p>
<p>mischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and</p>
<p>repair to a foreign country.’</p>
<p>The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way</p>
<p>together. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was</p>
<p>no bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over</p>
<p>it. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: ‘I will lay myself straight</p>
<p>across, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.’ The straw</p>
<p>therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal,</p>
<p>who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the</p>
<p>newly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the</p>
<p>water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still,</p>
<p>and ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in</p>
<p>two pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed</p>
<p>when she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had</p>
<p>prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event,</p>
<p>was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would</p>
<p>have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who</p>
<p>was travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook.</p>
<p>As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread,</p>
<p>and sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the</p>
<p>tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.</p>
