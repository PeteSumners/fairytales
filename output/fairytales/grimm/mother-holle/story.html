        <div class="story-content">
            <p>Once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them</p>
<p>was beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The mother,</p>
<p>however, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own</p>
<p>daughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made</p>
<p>to do all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the</p>
<p>family. Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well in</p>
<p>the high road, there to spin until she made her fingers bleed. Now it</p>
<p>chanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the girl</p>
<p>stopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang out</p>
<p>of her hand and fell into the well. She ran home crying to tell of her</p>
<p>misfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to her, and after giving</p>
<p>her a violent scolding, said unkindly, ‘As you have let the spindle fall</p>
<p>into the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.’</p>
<p>The girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last in</p>
<p>her distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.</p>
<p>She remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a</p>
<p>beautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers blooming</p>
<p>in every direction.</p>
<p>She walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker’s oven</p>
<p>full of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, ‘Take us out, take us</p>
<p>out, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long</p>
<p>ago.’ So she took the bread-shovel and drew them all out.</p>
<p>She went on a little farther, till she came to a tree full of apples.</p>
<p>‘Shake me, shake me, I pray,’ cried the tree; ‘my apples, one and all,</p>
<p>are ripe.’ So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down upon</p>
<p>her like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a single</p>
<p>apple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a</p>
<p>heap and walked on again.</p>
<p>The next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old</p>
<p>woman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and</p>
<p>turned to run away. But the old woman called after her, ‘What are you</p>
<p>afraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do the work of my house</p>
<p>properly for me, I will make you very happy. You must be very careful,</p>
<p>however, to make my bed in the right way, for I wish you always to shake</p>
<p>it thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then they say, down there</p>
<p>in the world, that it is snowing; for I am Mother Holle.’ The old woman</p>
<p>spoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter</p>
<p>into her service.</p>
<p>She took care to do everything according to the old woman’s bidding and</p>
<p>every time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so that the</p>
<p>feathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman was as good</p>
<p>as her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her roast and</p>
<p>boiled meats every day.</p>
<p>So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began</p>
<p>to grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she</p>
<p>became conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she</p>
<p>was homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother</p>
<p>Holle than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile, she went</p>
<p>to Mother Holle and said, ‘I am so homesick, that I cannot stay with</p>
<p>you any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own</p>
<p>people.’</p>
<p>Then Mother Holle said, ‘I am pleased that you should want to go back</p>
<p>to your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I</p>
<p>will take you home myself.’</p>
<p>Thereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gate</p>
<p>was opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold fell upon</p>
<p>her, and the gold clung to her, so that she was covered with it from</p>
<p>head to foot.</p>
<p>‘That is a reward for your industry,’ said Mother Holle, and as she</p>
<p>spoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.</p>
<p>The gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old</p>
<p>world close to her mother’s house. As she entered the courtyard, the</p>
<p>cock who was perched on the well, called out:</p>
<p>‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!</p>
<p>Your golden daughter’s come back to you.’</p>
<p>Then she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly</p>
<p>covered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them</p>
<p>all that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her</p>
<p>great riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go</p>
<p>and try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the well</p>
<p>and spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a</p>
<p>thorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then</p>
<p>she threw it into the well, and jumped in herself.</p>
<p>Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it</p>
<p>till she came to the oven. ‘Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall</p>
<p>be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,’ cried the loaves</p>
<p>as before. But the lazy girl answered, ‘Do you think I am going to dirty</p>
<p>my hands for you?’ and walked on.</p>
<p>Presently she came to the apple-tree. ‘Shake me, shake me, I pray; my</p>
<p>apples, one and all, are ripe,’ it cried. But she only answered, ‘A nice</p>
<p>thing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,’ and</p>
<p>passed on.</p>
<p>At last she came to Mother Holle’s house, and as she had heard all about</p>
<p>the large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged</p>
<p>herself without delay to the old woman.</p>
<p>The first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself</p>
<p>to please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in</p>
<p>return. The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and</p>
<p>the third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in</p>
<p>the mornings and refused to get up. Worse still, she neglected to</p>
<p>make the old woman’s bed properly, and forgot to shake it so that the</p>
<p>feathers might fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her,</p>
<p>and told her she might go. The lazy girl was delighted at this, and</p>
<p>thought to herself, ‘The gold will soon be mine.’ Mother Holle led her,</p>
<p>as she had led her sister, to the broad gateway; but as she was passing</p>
<p>through, instead of the shower of gold, a great bucketful of pitch came</p>
<p>pouring over her.</p>
<p>‘That is in return for your services,’ said the old woman, and she shut</p>
<p>the gate.</p>
<p>So the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock on the</p>
<p>well called out as she saw her:</p>
<p>‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!</p>
<p>Your dirty daughter’s come back to you.’</p>
<p>But, try what she would, she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to</p>
<p>her as long as she lived.</p>
<p>LITTLE RED-CAP [LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone</p>
<p>who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was</p>
<p>nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a</p>
<p>little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never</p>
<p>wear anything else; so she was always called ‘Little Red-Cap.’</p>
<p>One day her mother said to her: ‘Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece</p>
<p>of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill</p>
<p>and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and</p>
<p>when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path,</p>
<p>or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will</p>
<p>get nothing; and when you go into her room, don’t forget to say, “Good</p>
<p>morning”, and don’t peep into every corner before you do it.’</p>
<p>‘I will take great care,’ said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave</p>
<p>her hand on it.</p>
<p>The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village,</p>
<p>and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap</p>
<p>did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>‘Good day, Little Red-Cap,’ said he.</p>
<p>‘Thank you kindly, wolf.’</p>
<p>‘Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?’</p>
<p>‘To my grandmother’s.’</p>
<p>‘What have you got in your apron?’</p>
<p>‘Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to</p>
<p>have something good, to make her stronger.’</p>
<p>‘Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?’</p>
<p>‘A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands</p>
<p>under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you</p>
<p>surely must know it,’ replied Little Red-Cap.</p>
<p>The wolf thought to himself: ‘What a tender young creature! what a nice</p>
<p>plump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must</p>
<p>act craftily, so as to catch both.’ So he walked for a short time by</p>
<p>the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: ‘See, Little Red-Cap, how</p>
<p>pretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round? I believe,</p>
<p>too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you</p>
<p>walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else</p>
<p>out here in the wood is merry.’</p>
<p>Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing</p>
<p>here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere,</p>
<p>she thought: ‘Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would</p>
<p>please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there</p>
<p>in good time’; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for</p>
<p>flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a</p>
<p>still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and</p>
<p>deeper into the wood.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother’s house and knocked</p>
<p>at the door.</p>
<p>‘Who is there?’</p>
<p>‘Little Red-Cap,’ replied the wolf. ‘She is bringing cake and wine; open</p>
<p>the door.’</p>
<p>‘Lift the latch,’ called out the grandmother, ‘I am too weak, and cannot</p>
<p>get up.’</p>
<p>The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a</p>
<p>word he went straight to the grandmother’s bed, and devoured her. Then</p>
<p>he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed</p>
<p>and drew the curtains.</p>
<p>Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers,</p>
<p>and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she</p>
<p>remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.</p>
<p>She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she</p>
<p>went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to</p>
<p>herself: ‘Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like</p>
<p>being with grandmother so much.’ She called out: ‘Good morning,’ but</p>
<p>received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.</p>
<p>There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and</p>
<p>looking very strange.</p>
<p>‘Oh! grandmother,’ she said, ‘what big ears you have!’</p>
<p>‘The better to hear you with, my child,’ was the reply.</p>
<p>‘But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!’ she said.</p>
<p>‘The better to see you with, my dear.’</p>
<p>‘But, grandmother, what large hands you have!’</p>
<p>‘The better to hug you with.’</p>
<p>‘Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!’</p>
<p>‘The better to eat you with!’</p>
<p>And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of</p>
<p>bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.</p>
<p>When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed,</p>
<p>fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing</p>
<p>the house, and thought to himself: ‘How the old woman is snoring! I must</p>
<p>just see if she wants anything.’ So he went into the room, and when he</p>
<p>came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. ‘Do I find you</p>
<p>here, you old sinner!’ said he. ‘I have long sought you!’ Then just as</p>
<p>he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have</p>
<p>devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did</p>
<p>not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach</p>
<p>of the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little</p>
<p>Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl</p>
<p>sprang out, crying: ‘Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was</p>
<p>inside the wolf’; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive</p>
<p>also, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched</p>
<p>great stones with which they filled the wolf’s belly, and when he awoke,</p>
<p>he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at</p>
<p>once, and fell dead.</p>
<p>Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf’s skin and</p>
<p>went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which</p>
<p>Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: ‘As</p>
<p>long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the</p>
<p>wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.’</p>
<p>It also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old</p>
<p>grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the</p>
<p>path. Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on</p>
<p>her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he</p>
<p>had said ‘good morning’ to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes,</p>
<p>that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would</p>
<p>have eaten her up. ‘Well,’ said the grandmother, ‘we will shut the door,</p>
<p>that he may not come in.’ Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried:</p>
<p>‘Open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you</p>
<p>some cakes.’ But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard</p>
<p>stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof,</p>
<p>intending to wait until Red-Cap went home in the evening, and then to</p>
<p>steal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother</p>
<p>saw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone</p>
<p>trough, so she said to the child: ‘Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some</p>
<p>sausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the</p>
<p>trough.’ Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the</p>
<p>smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down,</p>
<p>and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep</p>
<p>his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight</p>
<p>into the great trough, and was drowned. But Red-Cap went joyously home,</p>
<p>and no one ever did anything to harm her again.</p>
