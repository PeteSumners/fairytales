            <p>The mother of Hans said: ‘Whither away, Hans?’ Hans answered: ‘To</p>
<p>Gretel.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh, I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’</p>
<p>‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day,</p>
<p>Hans. What do you bring that is good?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want to have</p>
<p>something given me.’ Gretel presents Hans with a needle, Hans says:</p>
<p>‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’</p>
<p>Hans takes the needle, sticks it into a hay-cart, and follows the cart</p>
<p>home. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’</p>
<p>‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘Took nothing; had something</p>
<p>given me.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a needle.’ ‘Where is the</p>
<p>needle, Hans?’ ‘Stuck in the hay-cart.’ ‘That was ill done, Hans. You</p>
<p>should have stuck the needle in your sleeve.’ ‘Never mind, I’ll do</p>
<p>better next time.’</p>
<p>‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,</p>
<p>I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to</p>
<p>Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What do you bring that is</p>
<p>good?’ ‘I bring nothing. I want to have something given to me.’ Gretel</p>
<p>presents Hans with a knife. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans</p>
<p>takes the knife, sticks it in his sleeve, and goes home. ‘Good evening,</p>
<p>mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ What</p>
<p>did you take her?’ ‘Took her nothing, she gave me something.’ ‘What did</p>
<p>Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a knife.’ ‘Where is the knife, Hans?’ ‘Stuck</p>
<p>in my sleeve.’ ‘That’s ill done, Hans, you should have put the knife in</p>
<p>your pocket.’ ‘Never mind, will do better next time.’</p>
<p>‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,</p>
<p>I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to</p>
<p>Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good thing do you</p>
<p>bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want something given me.’ Gretel presents</p>
<p>Hans with a young goat. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans takes</p>
<p>the goat, ties its legs, and puts it in his pocket. When he gets home it</p>
<p>is suffocated. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have</p>
<p>you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘Took nothing, she</p>
<p>gave me something.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘She gave me a goat.’</p>
<p>‘Where is the goat, Hans?’ ‘Put it in my pocket.’ ‘That was ill done,</p>
<p>Hans, you should have put a rope round the goat’s neck.’ ‘Never mind,</p>
<p>will do better next time.’</p>
<p>‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,</p>
<p>I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to</p>
<p>Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good thing do you</p>
<p>bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want something given me.’ Gretel presents</p>
<p>Hans with a piece of bacon. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’</p>
<p>Hans takes the bacon, ties it to a rope, and drags it away behind him.</p>
<p>The dogs come and devour the bacon. When he gets home, he has the rope</p>
<p>in his hand, and there is no longer anything hanging on to it. ‘Good</p>
<p>evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With</p>
<p>Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘I took her nothing, she gave me</p>
<p>something.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a bit of bacon.’ ‘Where</p>
<p>is the bacon, Hans?’ ‘I tied it to a rope, brought it home, dogs took</p>
<p>it.’ ‘That was ill done, Hans, you should have carried the bacon on your</p>
<p>head.’ ‘Never mind, will do better next time.’</p>
<p>‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘I’ll</p>
<p>behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to Gretel.</p>
<p>‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans, What good thing do you bring?’ ‘I</p>
<p>bring nothing, but would have something given.’ Gretel presents Hans</p>
<p>with a calf. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’</p>
<p>Hans takes the calf, puts it on his head, and the calf kicks his face.</p>
<p>‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With</p>
<p>Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘I took nothing, but had something</p>
<p>given me.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘A calf.’ ‘Where have you the</p>
<p>calf, Hans?’ ‘I set it on my head and it kicked my face.’ ‘That was</p>
<p>ill done, Hans, you should have led the calf, and put it in the stall.’</p>
<p>‘Never mind, will do better next time.’</p>
<p>‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘I’ll</p>
<p>behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’</p>
<p>Hans comes to Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good</p>
<p>thing do you bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, but would have something given.’</p>
<p>Gretel says to Hans: ‘I will go with you.’</p>
<p>Hans takes Gretel, ties her to a rope, leads her to the rack, and binds</p>
<p>her fast. Then Hans goes to his mother. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good</p>
<p>evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take</p>
<p>her?’ ‘I took her nothing.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘She gave me</p>
<p>nothing, she came with me.’ ‘Where have you left Gretel?’ ‘I led her by</p>
<p>the rope, tied her to the rack, and scattered some grass for her.’ ‘That</p>
<p>was ill done, Hans, you should have cast friendly eyes on her.’ ‘Never</p>
<p>mind, will do better.’</p>
<p>Hans went into the stable, cut out all the calves’ and sheep’s eyes,</p>
<p>and threw them in Gretel’s face. Then Gretel became angry, tore herself</p>
<p>loose and ran away, and was no longer the bride of Hans.</p>
