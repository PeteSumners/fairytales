            <p>It was the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling</p>
<p>around, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working</p>
<p>at her window. The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony, and</p>
<p>as she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three</p>
<p>drops of blood fell upon it. Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red</p>
<p>drops that sprinkled the white snow, and said, ‘Would that my little</p>
<p>daughter may be as white as that snow, as red as that blood, and as</p>
<p>black as this ebony windowframe!’ And so the little girl really did grow</p>
<p>up; her skin was as white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as the blood, and</p>
<p>her hair as black as ebony; and she was called Snowdrop.</p>
<p>But this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who became</p>
<p>queen, and was very beautiful, but so vain that she could not bear</p>
<p>to think that anyone could be handsomer than she was. She had a fairy</p>
<p>looking-glass, to which she used to go, and then she would gaze upon</p>
<p>herself in it, and say:</p>
<p>‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!</p>
<p>Of all the ladies in the land,</p>
<p>Who is fairest, tell me, who?’</p>
<p>And the glass had always answered:</p>
<p>‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all the land.’</p>
<p>But Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years</p>
<p>old she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself.</p>
<p>Then the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to look in it</p>
<p>as usual:</p>
<p>‘Thou, queen, art fair, and beauteous to see,</p>
<p>But Snowdrop is lovelier far than thee!’</p>
<p>When she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to</p>
<p>one of her servants, and said, ‘Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood,</p>
<p>that I may never see her any more.’ Then the servant led her away; but</p>
<p>his heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life, and he</p>
<p>said, ‘I will not hurt you, thou pretty child.’ So he left her by</p>
<p>herself; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would</p>
<p>tear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his</p>
<p>heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to</p>
<p>her fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her.</p>
<p>Then poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear; and</p>
<p>the wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm. In the</p>
<p>evening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for</p>
<p>her little feet would carry her no further. Everything was spruce and</p>
<p>neat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there</p>
<p>were seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little glasses</p>
<p>with wine in them; and seven knives and forks laid in order; and by</p>
<p>the wall stood seven little beds. As she was very hungry, she picked</p>
<p>a little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of each</p>
<p>glass; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest. So she</p>
<p>tried all the little beds; but one was too long, and another was too</p>
<p>short, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself</p>
<p>down and went to sleep.</p>
<p>By and by in came the masters of the cottage. Now they were seven little</p>
<p>dwarfs, that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched for gold.</p>
<p>They lighted up their seven lamps, and saw at once that all was not</p>
<p>right. The first said, ‘Who has been sitting on my stool?’ The second,</p>
<p>‘Who has been eating off my plate?’ The third, ‘Who has been picking my</p>
<p>bread?’ The fourth, ‘Who has been meddling with my spoon?’ The fifth,</p>
<p>‘Who has been handling my fork?’ The sixth, ‘Who has been cutting with</p>
<p>my knife?’ The seventh, ‘Who has been drinking my wine?’ Then the first</p>
<p>looked round and said, ‘Who has been lying on my bed?’ And the rest came</p>
<p>running to him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his</p>
<p>bed. But the seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all his brethren to come</p>
<p>and see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought</p>
<p>their lamps to look at her, and said, ‘Good heavens! what a lovely child</p>
<p>she is!’ And they were very glad to see her, and took care not to wake</p>
<p>her; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs</p>
<p>in turn, till the night was gone.</p>
<p>In the morning Snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied her,</p>
<p>and said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash and</p>
<p>knit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would</p>
<p>take good care of her. Then they went out all day long to their work,</p>
<p>seeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but Snowdrop was left at</p>
<p>home; and they warned her, and said, ‘The queen will soon find out where</p>
<p>you are, so take care and let no one in.’</p>
<p>But the queen, now that she thought Snowdrop was dead, believed that she</p>
<p>must be the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her glass and</p>
<p>said:</p>
<p>‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!</p>
<p>Of all the ladies in the land,</p>
<p>Who is fairest, tell me, who?’</p>
<p>And the glass answered:</p>
<p>‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:</p>
<p>But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,</p>
<p>Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,</p>
<p>There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she</p>
<p>Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.’</p>
<p>Then the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass</p>
<p>always spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her.</p>
<p>And she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful</p>
<p>than she was; so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar, and went</p>
<p>her way over the hills, to the place where the dwarfs dwelt. Then she</p>
<p>knocked at the door, and cried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’ Snowdrop looked</p>
<p>out at the window, and said, ‘Good day, good woman! what have you to</p>
<p>sell?’ ‘Good wares, fine wares,’ said she; ‘laces and bobbins of all</p>
<p>colours.’ ‘I will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good</p>
<p>sort of body,’ thought Snowdrop, as she ran down and unbolted the door.</p>
<p>‘Bless me!’ said the old woman, ‘how badly your stays are laced! Let me</p>
<p>lace them up with one of my nice new laces.’ Snowdrop did not dream of</p>
<p>any mischief; so she stood before the old woman; but she set to work</p>
<p>so nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight, that Snowdrop’s breath was</p>
<p>stopped, and she fell down as if she were dead. ‘There’s an end to all</p>
<p>thy beauty,’ said the spiteful queen, and went away home.</p>
<p>In the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how</p>
<p>grieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the</p>
<p>ground, as if she was quite dead. However, they lifted her up, and when</p>
<p>they found what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a little time she</p>
<p>began to breathe, and very soon came to life again. Then they said, ‘The</p>
<p>old woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one</p>
<p>in when we are away.’</p>
<p>When the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it</p>
<p>as before; but to her great grief it still said:</p>
<p>‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:</p>
<p>But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,</p>
<p>Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,</p>
<p>There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she</p>
<p>Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.’</p>
<p>Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that</p>
<p>Snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite</p>
<p>another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned</p>
<p>comb. When she reached the dwarfs’ cottage, she knocked at the door, and</p>
<p>cried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’ But Snowdrop said, ‘I dare not let anyone</p>
<p>in.’ Then the queen said, ‘Only look at my beautiful combs!’ and gave</p>
<p>her the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty, that she took it up and</p>
<p>put it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head,</p>
<p>the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless. ‘There you may</p>
<p>lie,’ said the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs</p>
<p>came in very early that evening; and when they saw Snowdrop lying on</p>
<p>the ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned</p>
<p>comb. And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that</p>
<p>had passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to</p>
<p>anyone.</p>
<p>Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she</p>
<p>read the very same answer as before; and she said, ‘Snowdrop shall die,</p>
<p>if it cost me my life.’ So she went by herself into her chamber, and got</p>
<p>ready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but</p>
<p>whoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a</p>
<p>peasant’s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs’ cottage,</p>
<p>and knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and</p>
<p>said, ‘I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.’ ‘Do</p>
<p>as you please,’ said the old woman, ‘but at any rate take this pretty</p>
<p>apple; I will give it you.’ ‘No,’ said Snowdrop, ‘I dare not take it.’</p>
<p>‘You silly girl!’ answered the other, ‘what are you afraid of? Do you</p>
<p>think it is poisoned? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the</p>
<p>other.’ Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the</p>
<p>other side was poisoned. Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for</p>
<p>the apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she</p>
<p>could wait no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth,</p>
<p>when she fell down dead upon the ground. ‘This time nothing will save</p>
<p>thee,’ said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it</p>
<p>said:</p>
<p>‘Thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair.’</p>
<p>And then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could</p>
<p>be.</p>
<p>When evening came, and the dwarfs had gone home, they found Snowdrop</p>
<p>lying on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were afraid</p>
<p>that she was quite dead. They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and</p>
<p>washed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little</p>
<p>girl seemed quite dead. So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven</p>
<p>watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they</p>
<p>would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just</p>
<p>as it did while she was alive; so they said, ‘We will never bury her in</p>
<p>the cold ground.’ And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might</p>
<p>still look at her, and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name</p>
<p>was, and that she was a king’s daughter. And the coffin was set among</p>
<p>the hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the</p>
<p>birds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came</p>
<p>an owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side.</p>
<p>And thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as</p>
<p>though she was asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red</p>
<p>as blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the</p>
<p>dwarfs’ house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written in golden</p>
<p>letters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them</p>
<p>to let him take her away; but they said, ‘We will not part with her for</p>
<p>all the gold in the world.’ At last, however, they had pity on him, and</p>
<p>gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home</p>
<p>with him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop</p>
<p>awoke, and said, ‘Where am I?’ And the prince said, ‘Thou art quite safe</p>
<p>with me.’</p>
<p>Then he told her all that had happened, and said, ‘I love you far better</p>
<p>than all the world; so come with me to my father’s palace, and you shall</p>
<p>be my wife.’ And Snowdrop consented, and went home with the prince;</p>
<p>and everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their</p>
<p>wedding.</p>
<p>To the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdrop’s old enemy the queen;</p>
<p>and as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she looked in the</p>
<p>glass and said:</p>
<p>‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!</p>
<p>Of all the ladies in the land,</p>
<p>Who is fairest, tell me, who?’</p>
<p>And the glass answered:</p>
<p>‘Thou, lady, art loveliest here, I ween;</p>
<p>But lovelier far is the new-made queen.’</p>
<p>When she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity</p>
<p>were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride. And</p>
<p>when she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as</p>
<p>she thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell</p>
<p>down and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily</p>
<p>over that land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the</p>
<p>mountains, and paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind</p>
<p>to Snowdrop in her time of need.</p>
