            <p>An aged count once lived in Switzerland, who had an only son, but he</p>
<p>was stupid, and could learn nothing. Then said the father: ‘Hark you,</p>
<p>my son, try as I will I can get nothing into your head. You must go from</p>
<p>hence, I will give you into the care of a celebrated master, who shall</p>
<p>see what he can do with you.’ The youth was sent into a strange town,</p>
<p>and remained a whole year with the master. At the end of this time,</p>
<p>he came home again, and his father asked: ‘Now, my son, what have you</p>
<p>learnt?’ ‘Father, I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark.’ ‘Lord</p>
<p>have mercy on us!’ cried the father; ‘is that all you have learnt? I</p>
<p>will send you into another town, to another master.’ The youth was taken</p>
<p>thither, and stayed a year with this master likewise. When he came back</p>
<p>the father again asked: ‘My son, what have you learnt?’ He answered:</p>
<p>‘Father, I have learnt what the birds say.’ Then the father fell into a</p>
<p>rage and said: ‘Oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and</p>
<p>learnt nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes? I will</p>
<p>send you to a third master, but if you learn nothing this time also, I</p>
<p>will no longer be your father.’ The youth remained a whole year with the</p>
<p>third master also, and when he came home again, and his father inquired:</p>
<p>‘My son, what have you learnt?’ he answered: ‘Dear father, I have this</p>
<p>year learnt what the frogs croak.’ Then the father fell into the most</p>
<p>furious anger, sprang up, called his people thither, and said: ‘This man</p>
<p>is no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him</p>
<p>out into the forest, and kill him.’ They took him forth, but when they</p>
<p>should have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go,</p>
<p>and they cut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carry</p>
<p>them to the old man as a token.</p>
<p>The youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he</p>
<p>begged for a night’s lodging. ‘Yes,’ said the lord of the castle, ‘if</p>
<p>you will pass the night down there in the old tower, go thither; but I</p>
<p>warn you, it is at the peril of your life, for it is full of wild dogs,</p>
<p>which bark and howl without stopping, and at certain hours a man has to</p>
<p>be given to them, whom they at once devour.’ The whole district was in</p>
<p>sorrow and dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything to</p>
<p>stop this. The youth, however, was without fear, and said: ‘Just let me</p>
<p>go down to the barking dogs, and give me something that I can throw to</p>
<p>them; they will do nothing to harm me.’ As he himself would have it so,</p>
<p>they gave him some food for the wild animals, and led him down to the</p>
<p>tower. When he went inside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged</p>
<p>their tails quite amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and</p>
<p>did not hurt one hair of his head. Next morning, to the astonishment of</p>
<p>everyone, he came out again safe and unharmed, and said to the lord of</p>
<p>the castle: ‘The dogs have revealed to me, in their own language, why</p>
<p>they dwell there, and bring evil on the land. They are bewitched, and</p>
<p>are obliged to watch over a great treasure which is below in the tower,</p>
<p>and they can have no rest until it is taken away, and I have likewise</p>
<p>learnt, from their discourse, how that is to be done.’ Then all who</p>
<p>heard this rejoiced, and the lord of the castle said he would adopt him</p>
<p>as a son if he accomplished it successfully. He went down again, and</p>
<p>as he knew what he had to do, he did it thoroughly, and brought a chest</p>
<p>full of gold out with him. The howling of the wild dogs was henceforth</p>
<p>heard no more; they had disappeared, and the country was freed from the</p>
<p>trouble.</p>
<p>After some time he took it in his head that he would travel to Rome. On</p>
<p>the way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of frogs were sitting</p>
<p>croaking. He listened to them, and when he became aware of what they</p>
<p>were saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad. At last he arrived in</p>
<p>Rome, where the Pope had just died, and there was great doubt among</p>
<p>the cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his successor. They at</p>
<p>length agreed that the person should be chosen as pope who should be</p>
<p>distinguished by some divine and miraculous token. And just as that was</p>
<p>decided on, the young count entered into the church, and suddenly two</p>
<p>snow-white doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting there. The</p>
<p>ecclesiastics recognized therein the token from above, and asked him on</p>
<p>the spot if he would be pope. He was undecided, and knew not if he were</p>
<p>worthy of this, but the doves counselled him to do it, and at length he</p>
<p>said yes. Then was he anointed and consecrated, and thus was fulfilled</p>
<p>what he had heard from the frogs on his way, which had so affected him,</p>
<p>that he was to be his Holiness the Pope. Then he had to sing a mass, and</p>
<p>did not know one word of it, but the two doves sat continually on his</p>
<p>shoulders, and said it all in his ear.</p>
