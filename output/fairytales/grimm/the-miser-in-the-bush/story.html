        <div class="story-content">
            <p>A farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for</p>
<p>him three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came</p>
<p>into the man’s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer;</p>
<p>so he went to his master, and said, ‘I have worked hard for you a long</p>
<p>time, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my</p>
<p>trouble.’ The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very</p>
<p>simple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year’s</p>
<p>service a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to</p>
<p>have, and said to himself, ‘Why should I work hard, and live here on bad</p>
<p>fare any longer? I can now travel into the wide world, and make myself</p>
<p>merry.’ With that he put his money into his purse, and set out, roaming</p>
<p>over hill and valley.</p>
<p>As he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf</p>
<p>met him, and asked him what made him so merry. ‘Why, what should make</p>
<p>me down-hearted?’ said he; ‘I am sound in health and rich in purse, what</p>
<p>should I care for? I have saved up my three years’ earnings and have it</p>
<p>all safe in my pocket.’ ‘How much may it come to?’ said the little man.</p>
<p>‘Full threepence,’ replied the countryman. ‘I wish you would give them</p>
<p>to me,’ said the other; ‘I am very poor.’ Then the man pitied him, and</p>
<p>gave him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return, ‘As you have</p>
<p>such a kind honest heart, I will grant you three wishes--one for every</p>
<p>penny; so choose whatever you like.’ Then the countryman rejoiced at</p>
<p>his good luck, and said, ‘I like many things better than money: first, I</p>
<p>will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly,</p>
<p>a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and</p>
<p>thirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.’ The dwarf</p>
<p>said he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle,</p>
<p>and went his way.</p>
<p>Our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before,</p>
<p>he was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he met an old</p>
<p>miser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush</p>
<p>singing away most joyfully. ‘Oh, what a pretty bird!’ said the miser; ‘I</p>
<p>would give a great deal of money to have such a one.’ ‘If that’s all,’</p>
<p>said the countryman, ‘I will soon bring it down.’ Then he took up his</p>
<p>bow, and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree.</p>
<p>The miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into</p>
<p>the middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the</p>
<p>miser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in</p>
<p>the air. The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung</p>
<p>in rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that</p>
<p>the blood ran down. ‘Oh, for heaven’s sake!’ cried the miser, ‘Master!</p>
<p>master! pray let the fiddle alone. What have I done to deserve this?’</p>
<p>‘Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough,’ said the other; ‘thou</p>
<p>art only meeting thy reward’: so he played up another tune. Then the</p>
<p>miser began to beg and promise, and offered money for his liberty; but</p>
<p>he did not come up to the musician’s price for some time, and he danced</p>
<p>him along brisker and brisker, and the miser bid higher and higher, till</p>
<p>at last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse,</p>
<p>and had just gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countryman</p>
<p>saw so much money, he said, ‘I will agree to your proposal.’ So he took</p>
<p>the purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his</p>
<p>bargain.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous</p>
<p>plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve</p>
<p>his late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge, and</p>
<p>complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him</p>
<p>into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his</p>
<p>back and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his</p>
<p>officers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he</p>
<p>was soon caught and brought up to be tried.</p>
<p>The miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of</p>
<p>his money. ‘No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.’ said the</p>
<p>countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the</p>
<p>matter short by ordering him off to the gallows.</p>
<p>So away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, ‘My Lord</p>
<p>Judge, grant me one last request.’ ‘Anything but thy life,’ replied the</p>
<p>other. ‘No,’ said he, ‘I do not ask my life; only to let me play upon</p>
<p>my fiddle for the last time.’ The miser cried out, ‘Oh, no! no! for</p>
<p>heaven’s sake don’t listen to him! don’t listen to him!’ But the judge</p>
<p>said, ‘It is only this once, he will soon have done.’ The fact was, he</p>
<p>could not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf’s third gift.</p>
<p>Then the miser said, ‘Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity’s sake.’ But</p>
<p>the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first</p>
<p>note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and</p>
<p>no one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let his</p>
<p>prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first</p>
<p>bar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and</p>
<p>all the people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merry</p>
<p>and pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed</p>
<p>to be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him</p>
<p>to leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties,</p>
<p>till the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him</p>
<p>the hundred florins.</p>
<p>Then he called to the miser, and said, ‘Tell us now, you vagabond, where</p>
<p>you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,’ ‘I stole</p>
<p>it,’ said the miser in the presence of all the people; ‘I acknowledge</p>
<p>that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.’ Then the countryman</p>
<p>stopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.</p>
