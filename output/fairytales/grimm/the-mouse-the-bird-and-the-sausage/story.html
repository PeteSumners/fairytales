            <p>Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into</p>
<p>partnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;</p>
<p>they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add</p>
<p>considerably to their stores. The bird’s duty was to fly daily into the</p>
<p>wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw</p>
<p>to the cooking.</p>
<p>When people are too well off they always begin to long for something</p>
<p>new. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a</p>
<p>fellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his</p>
<p>household arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a</p>
<p>poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed</p>
<p>at home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire</p>
<p>and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest</p>
<p>until it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the</p>
<p>pot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near</p>
<p>dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out</p>
<p>among the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered,</p>
<p>and salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and</p>
<p>had laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had</p>
<p>finished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following</p>
<p>morning: and that was really a very delightful life.</p>
<p>Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in</p>
<p>the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough,</p>
<p>and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a</p>
<p>change, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray</p>
<p>as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained</p>
<p>master of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore</p>
<p>drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse</p>
<p>to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.</p>
<p>And now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird</p>
<p>made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited</p>
<p>till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the</p>
<p>sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird</p>
<p>flew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across</p>
<p>a dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate</p>
<p>booty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog</p>
<p>of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for</p>
<p>the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and</p>
<p>that was the reason his life had been forfeited.</p>
<p>He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he</p>
<p>had seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the</p>
<p>best of things and to remain with one another.</p>
<p>So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and,</p>
<p>wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and</p>
<p>out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the</p>
<p>pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having</p>
<p>already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.</p>
<p>Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he</p>
<p>could nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood</p>
<p>here and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to</p>
<p>be found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down,</p>
<p>caught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water,</p>
<p>but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable</p>
<p>to recover himself, he was drowned.</p>
