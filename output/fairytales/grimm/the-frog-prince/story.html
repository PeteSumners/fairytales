            <p>One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went</p>
<p>out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool</p>
<p>spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down</p>
<p>to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her</p>
<p>favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and</p>
<p>catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that</p>
<p>she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled</p>
<p>along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The</p>
<p>princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so</p>
<p>deep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail</p>
<p>her loss, and said, ‘Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would</p>
<p>give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the</p>
<p>world.’</p>
<p>Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,</p>
<p>‘Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘what can you</p>
<p>do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.’</p>
<p>The frog said, ‘I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes;</p>
<p>but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off</p>
<p>your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball</p>
<p>again.’ ‘What nonsense,’ thought the princess, ‘this silly frog is</p>
<p>talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though</p>
<p>he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he</p>
<p>shall have what he asks.’ So she said to the frog, ‘Well, if you will</p>
<p>bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.’ Then the frog put his head</p>
<p>down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came</p>
<p>up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the</p>
<p>spring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick</p>
<p>it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she</p>
<p>never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.</p>
<p>The frog called after her, ‘Stay, princess, and take me with you as you</p>
<p>said,’ But she did not stop to hear a word.</p>
<p>The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a</p>
<p>strange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the</p>
<p>marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the</p>
<p>door, and a little voice cried out and said:</p>
<p>‘Open the door, my princess dear,</p>
<p>Open the door to thy true love here!</p>
<p>And mind the words that thou and I said</p>
<p>By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’</p>
<p>Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw</p>
<p>the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly</p>
<p>frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her</p>
<p>seat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her,</p>
<p>asked her what was the matter. ‘There is a nasty frog,’ said she, ‘at</p>
<p>the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I</p>
<p>told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never</p>
<p>get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come</p>
<p>in.’</p>
<p>While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:</p>
<p>‘Open the door, my princess dear,</p>
<p>Open the door to thy true love here!</p>
<p>And mind the words that thou and I said</p>
<p>By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’</p>
<p>Then the king said to the young princess, ‘As you have given your word</p>
<p>you must keep it; so go and let him in.’ She did so, and the frog hopped</p>
<p>into the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the</p>
<p>bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where</p>
<p>the princess sat. ‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he to the princess,</p>
<p>‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as she had done this, the frog</p>
<p>said, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’ This</p>
<p>she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ‘Now I am</p>
<p>tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’ And the princess,</p>
<p>though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the</p>
<p>pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was</p>
<p>light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.</p>
<p>‘Now, then,’ thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone, and I shall be</p>
<p>troubled with him no more.’</p>
<p>But she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same</p>
<p>tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:</p>
<p>‘Open the door, my princess dear,</p>
<p>Open the door to thy true love here!</p>
<p>And mind the words that thou and I said</p>
<p>By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’</p>
<p>And when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon</p>
<p>her pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did</p>
<p>the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was</p>
<p>astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her</p>
<p>with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head</p>
<p>of her bed.</p>
<p>He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had</p>
<p>changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till</p>
<p>some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from</p>
<p>her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. ‘You,’ said the</p>
<p>prince, ‘have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for</p>
<p>but that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where I will</p>
<p>marry you, and love you as long as you live.’</p>
<p>The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’ to</p>
<p>all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful</p>
<p>horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind</p>
<p>the coach rode the prince’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed</p>
<p>the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so</p>
<p>bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.</p>
<p>They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight</p>
<p>horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince’s</p>
<p>kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great</p>
<p>many years.</p>
