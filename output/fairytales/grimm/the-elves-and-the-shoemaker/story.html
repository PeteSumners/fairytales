            <p>There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest:</p>
<p>but still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he</p>
<p>had in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of</p>
<p>shoes.</p>
<p>Then he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning</p>
<p>to rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear and</p>
<p>his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed,</p>
<p>left all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the morning after</p>
<p>he had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his</p>
<p>great wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table. The</p>
<p>good man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening.</p>
<p>He looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the</p>
<p>whole job; all was so neat and true, that it was quite a masterpiece.</p>
<p>The same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that</p>
<p>he willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor</p>
<p>shoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs more.</p>
<p>In the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might</p>
<p>get up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for</p>
<p>when he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soon</p>
<p>in came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought</p>
<p>leather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight</p>
<p>and found it done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some</p>
<p>time: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and</p>
<p>the good man soon became thriving and well off again.</p>
<p>One evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over</p>
<p>the fire chatting together, he said to her, ‘I should like to sit up and</p>
<p>watch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for</p>
<p>me.’ The wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning, and hid</p>
<p>themselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up</p>
<p>there, and watched what would happen.</p>
<p>As soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and</p>
<p>they sat themselves upon the shoemaker’s bench, took up all the work</p>
<p>that was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching</p>
<p>and rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all</p>
<p>wonder, and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went, till the</p>
<p>job was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table.</p>
<p>This was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as</p>
<p>lightning.</p>
<p>The next day the wife said to the shoemaker. ‘These little wights have</p>
<p>made us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good</p>
<p>turn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and</p>
<p>indeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to</p>
<p>keep off the cold. I’ll tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt,</p>
<p>and a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and</p>
<p>do you make each of them a little pair of shoes.’</p>
<p>The thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when</p>
<p>all the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the</p>
<p>work that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to</p>
<p>watch what the little elves would do.</p>
<p>About midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the</p>
<p>room, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they</p>
<p>saw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed</p>
<p>mightily delighted.</p>
<p>Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and</p>
<p>capered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced</p>
<p>out at the door, and away over the green.</p>
<p>The good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them</p>
<p>from that time forward, as long as they lived.</p>
