            <p>There was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with</p>
<p>two oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two</p>
<p>talers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that</p>
<p>the doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he</p>
<p>ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly</p>
<p>have been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length</p>
<p>inquired if he too could not be a doctor. ‘Oh, yes,’ said the doctor,</p>
<p>‘that is soon managed.’ ‘What must I do?’ asked the peasant. ‘In the</p>
<p>first place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on</p>
<p>the frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into</p>
<p>money, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to</p>
<p>medicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words: “I</p>
<p>am Doctor Knowall,” and have that nailed up above your house-door.’ The</p>
<p>peasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored</p>
<p>people awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money</p>
<p>stolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such</p>
<p>a village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had</p>
<p>the horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and</p>
<p>asked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was</p>
<p>to go with him and bring back the stolen money. ‘Oh, yes, but Grete, my</p>
<p>wife, must go too.’ The lord was willing, and let both of them have a</p>
<p>seat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. When they came</p>
<p>to the nobleman’s castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to</p>
<p>sit down and eat. ‘Yes, but my wife, Grete, too,’ said he, and he seated</p>
<p>himself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a</p>
<p>dish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: ‘Grete,</p>
<p>that was the first,’ meaning that was the servant who brought the first</p>
<p>dish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: ‘That is</p>
<p>the first thief,’ and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said</p>
<p>to his comrade outside: ‘The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he</p>
<p>said I was the first.’ The second did not want to go in at all, but was</p>
<p>forced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife,</p>
<p>and said: ‘Grete, that is the second.’ This servant was equally alarmed,</p>
<p>and he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better, for the</p>
<p>peasant again said: ‘Grete, that is the third.’ The fourth had to carry</p>
<p>in a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to</p>
<p>show his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually, there</p>
<p>were crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and</p>
<p>cried: ‘Ah, poor Crabb.’ When the lord heard that, he cried: ‘There! he</p>
<p>knows it; he must also know who has the money!’</p>
<p>On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the</p>
<p>doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore</p>
<p>he went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen</p>
<p>the money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a</p>
<p>heavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he</p>
<p>did they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was</p>
<p>concealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall,</p>
<p>sat down to the table, and said: ‘My lord, now will I search in my book</p>
<p>where the gold is hidden.’ The fifth servant, however, crept into the</p>
<p>stove to hear if the doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still</p>
<p>and opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and</p>
<p>looked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said: ‘I</p>
<p>know you are there, so you had better come out!’ Then the fellow in the</p>
<p>stove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out,</p>
<p>crying: ‘That man knows everything!’ Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord</p>
<p>where the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received</p>
<p>from both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man.</p>
