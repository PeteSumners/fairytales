        <div class="story-content">
            <p>A merchant, who had three daughters, was once setting out upon a</p>
<p>journey; but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he should</p>
<p>bring back for her. The eldest wished for pearls; the second for jewels;</p>
<p>but the third, who was called Lily, said, ‘Dear father, bring me a</p>
<p>rose.’ Now it was no easy task to find a rose, for it was the middle</p>
<p>of winter; yet as she was his prettiest daughter, and was very fond of</p>
<p>flowers, her father said he would try what he could do. So he kissed all</p>
<p>three, and bid them goodbye.</p>
<p>And when the time came for him to go home, he had bought pearls and</p>
<p>jewels for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for the</p>
<p>rose; and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing, the</p>
<p>people laughed at him, and asked him whether he thought roses grew in</p>
<p>snow. This grieved him very much, for Lily was his dearest child; and as</p>
<p>he was journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he came to a</p>
<p>fine castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half of which it</p>
<p>seemed to be summer-time and in the other half winter. On one side the</p>
<p>finest flowers were in full bloom, and on the other everything looked</p>
<p>dreary and buried in the snow. ‘A lucky hit!’ said he, as he called to</p>
<p>his servant, and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was</p>
<p>there, and bring him away one of the finest flowers.</p>
<p>This done, they were riding away well pleased, when up sprang a fierce</p>
<p>lion, and roared out, ‘Whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten up</p>
<p>alive!’ Then the man said, ‘I knew not that the garden belonged to you;</p>
<p>can nothing save my life?’ ‘No!’ said the lion, ‘nothing, unless you</p>
<p>undertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home; if you</p>
<p>agree to this, I will give you your life, and the rose too for your</p>
<p>daughter.’ But the man was unwilling to do so and said, ‘It may be my</p>
<p>youngest daughter, who loves me most, and always runs to meet me when</p>
<p>I go home.’ Then the servant was greatly frightened, and said, ‘It may</p>
<p>perhaps be only a cat or a dog.’ And at last the man yielded with a</p>
<p>heavy heart, and took the rose; and said he would give the lion whatever</p>
<p>should meet him first on his return.</p>
<p>And as he came near home, it was Lily, his youngest and dearest</p>
<p>daughter, that met him; she came running, and kissed him, and welcomed</p>
<p>him home; and when she saw that he had brought her the rose, she was</p>
<p>still more glad. But her father began to be very sorrowful, and to weep,</p>
<p>saying, ‘Alas, my dearest child! I have bought this flower at a high</p>
<p>price, for I have said I would give you to a wild lion; and when he has</p>
<p>you, he will tear you in pieces, and eat you.’ Then he told her all that</p>
<p>had happened, and said she should not go, let what would happen.</p>
<p>But she comforted him, and said, ‘Dear father, the word you have given</p>
<p>must be kept; I will go to the lion, and soothe him: perhaps he will let</p>
<p>me come safe home again.’</p>
<p>The next morning she asked the way she was to go, and took leave of her</p>
<p>father, and went forth with a bold heart into the wood. But the lion was</p>
<p>an enchanted prince. By day he and all his court were lions, but in the</p>
<p>evening they took their right forms again. And when Lily came to the</p>
<p>castle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him. The</p>
<p>wedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time. The</p>
<p>prince was only to be seen as soon as evening came, and then he held his</p>
<p>court; but every morning he left his bride, and went away by himself,</p>
<p>she knew not whither, till the night came again.</p>
<p>After some time he said to her, ‘Tomorrow there will be a great feast in</p>
<p>your father’s house, for your eldest sister is to be married; and if</p>
<p>you wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither.’ Then she</p>
<p>rejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set</p>
<p>out with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had</p>
<p>thought her dead long since. But she told them how happy she was, and</p>
<p>stayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood.</p>
<p>Her second sister was soon after married, and when Lily was asked to</p>
<p>go to the wedding, she said to the prince, ‘I will not go alone this</p>
<p>time--you must go with me.’ But he would not, and said that it would be</p>
<p>a very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch-light should</p>
<p>fall upon him his enchantment would become still worse, for he should be</p>
<p>changed into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world for seven</p>
<p>long years. However, she gave him no rest, and said she would take care</p>
<p>no light should fall upon him. So at last they set out together, and</p>
<p>took with them their little child; and she chose a large hall with thick</p>
<p>walls for him to sit in while the wedding-torches were lighted; but,</p>
<p>unluckily, no one saw that there was a crack in the door. Then the</p>
<p>wedding was held with great pomp, but as the train came from the church,</p>
<p>and passed with the torches before the hall, a very small ray of light</p>
<p>fell upon the prince. In a moment he disappeared, and when his wife came</p>
<p>in and looked for him, she found only a white dove; and it said to her,</p>
<p>‘Seven years must I fly up and down over the face of the earth, but</p>
<p>every now and then I will let fall a white feather, that will show you</p>
<p>the way I am going; follow it, and at last you may overtake and set me</p>
<p>free.’</p>
<p>This said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every</p>
<p>now and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to</p>
<p>journey. Thus she went roving on through the wide world, and looked</p>
<p>neither to the right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for seven</p>
<p>years. Then she began to be glad, and thought to herself that the time</p>
<p>was fast coming when all her troubles should end; yet repose was still</p>
<p>far off, for one day as she was travelling on she missed the white</p>
<p>feather, and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove.</p>
<p>‘Now,’ thought she to herself, ‘no aid of man can be of use to me.’ So</p>
<p>she went to the sun and said, ‘Thou shinest everywhere, on the hill’s</p>
<p>top and the valley’s depth--hast thou anywhere seen my white dove?’</p>
<p>‘No,’ said the sun, ‘I have not seen it; but I will give thee a</p>
<p>casket--open it when thy hour of need comes.’</p>
<p>So she thanked the sun, and went on her way till eventide; and when</p>
<p>the moon arose, she cried unto it, and said, ‘Thou shinest through the</p>
<p>night, over field and grove--hast thou nowhere seen my white dove?’</p>
<p>‘No,’ said the moon, ‘I cannot help thee but I will give thee an</p>
<p>egg--break it when need comes.’</p>
<p>Then she thanked the moon, and went on till the night-wind blew; and she</p>
<p>raised up her voice to it, and said, ‘Thou blowest through every tree</p>
<p>and under every leaf--hast thou not seen my white dove?’ ‘No,’ said the</p>
<p>night-wind, ‘but I will ask three other winds; perhaps they have seen</p>
<p>it.’ Then the east wind and the west wind came, and said they too had</p>
<p>not seen it, but the south wind said, ‘I have seen the white dove--he</p>
<p>has fled to the Red Sea, and is changed once more into a lion, for the</p>
<p>seven years are passed away, and there he is fighting with a dragon;</p>
<p>and the dragon is an enchanted princess, who seeks to separate him from</p>
<p>you.’ Then the night-wind said, ‘I will give thee counsel. Go to the</p>
<p>Red Sea; on the right shore stand many rods--count them, and when thou</p>
<p>comest to the eleventh, break it off, and smite the dragon with it; and</p>
<p>so the lion will have the victory, and both of them will appear to you</p>
<p>in their own forms. Then look round and thou wilt see a griffin, winged</p>
<p>like bird, sitting by the Red Sea; jump on to his back with thy beloved</p>
<p>one as quickly as possible, and he will carry you over the waters to</p>
<p>your home. I will also give thee this nut,’ continued the night-wind.</p>
<p>‘When you are half-way over, throw it down, and out of the waters will</p>
<p>immediately spring up a high nut-tree on which the griffin will be able</p>
<p>to rest, otherwise he would not have the strength to bear you the whole</p>
<p>way; if, therefore, thou dost forget to throw down the nut, he will let</p>
<p>you both fall into the sea.’</p>
<p>So our poor wanderer went forth, and found all as the night-wind had</p>
<p>said; and she plucked the eleventh rod, and smote the dragon, and the</p>
<p>lion forthwith became a prince, and the dragon a princess again. But</p>
<p>no sooner was the princess released from the spell, than she seized</p>
<p>the prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffin’s back, and went off</p>
<p>carrying the prince away with her.</p>
<p>Thus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she</p>
<p>took heart and said, ‘As far as the wind blows, and so long as the cock</p>
<p>crows, I will journey on, till I find him once again.’ She went on for</p>
<p>a long, long way, till at length she came to the castle whither the</p>
<p>princess had carried the prince; and there was a feast got ready, and</p>
<p>she heard that the wedding was about to be held. ‘Heaven aid me now!’</p>
<p>said she; and she took the casket that the sun had given her, and found</p>
<p>that within it lay a dress as dazzling as the sun itself. So she put it</p>
<p>on, and went into the palace, and all the people gazed upon her; and</p>
<p>the dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether it was to be</p>
<p>sold. ‘Not for gold and silver.’ said she, ‘but for flesh and blood.’</p>
<p>The princess asked what she meant, and she said, ‘Let me speak with the</p>
<p>bridegroom this night in his chamber, and I will give thee the dress.’</p>
<p>At last the princess agreed, but she told her chamberlain to give the</p>
<p>prince a sleeping draught, that he might not hear or see her. When</p>
<p>evening came, and the prince had fallen asleep, she was led into</p>
<p>his chamber, and she sat herself down at his feet, and said: ‘I have</p>
<p>followed thee seven years. I have been to the sun, the moon, and the</p>
<p>night-wind, to seek thee, and at last I have helped thee to overcome</p>
<p>the dragon. Wilt thou then forget me quite?’ But the prince all the time</p>
<p>slept so soundly, that her voice only passed over him, and seemed like</p>
<p>the whistling of the wind among the fir-trees.</p>
<p>Then poor Lily was led away, and forced to give up the golden dress; and</p>
<p>when she saw that there was no help for her, she went out into a meadow,</p>
<p>and sat herself down and wept. But as she sat she bethought herself of</p>
<p>the egg that the moon had given her; and when she broke it, there ran</p>
<p>out a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold, that played about, and then</p>
<p>nestled under the old one’s wings, so as to form the most beautiful</p>
<p>sight in the world. And she rose up and drove them before her, till the</p>
<p>bride saw them from her window, and was so pleased that she came forth</p>
<p>and asked her if she would sell the brood. ‘Not for gold or silver, but</p>
<p>for flesh and blood: let me again this evening speak with the bridegroom</p>
<p>in his chamber, and I will give thee the whole brood.’</p>
<p>Then the princess thought to betray her as before, and agreed to</p>
<p>what she asked: but when the prince went to his chamber he asked</p>
<p>the chamberlain why the wind had whistled so in the night. And the</p>
<p>chamberlain told him all--how he had given him a sleeping draught, and</p>
<p>how a poor maiden had come and spoken to him in his chamber, and was</p>
<p>to come again that night. Then the prince took care to throw away the</p>
<p>sleeping draught; and when Lily came and began again to tell him what</p>
<p>woes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him she had been,</p>
<p>he knew his beloved wife’s voice, and sprang up, and said, ‘You have</p>
<p>awakened me as from a dream, for the strange princess had thrown a spell</p>
<p>around me, so that I had altogether forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent</p>
<p>you to me in a lucky hour.’</p>
<p>And they stole away out of the palace by night unawares, and seated</p>
<p>themselves on the griffin, who flew back with them over the Red Sea.</p>
<p>When they were half-way across Lily let the nut fall into the water,</p>
<p>and immediately a large nut-tree arose from the sea, whereon the griffin</p>
<p>rested for a while, and then carried them safely home. There they found</p>
<p>their child, now grown up to be comely and fair; and after all their</p>
<p>troubles they lived happily together to the end of their days.</p>
