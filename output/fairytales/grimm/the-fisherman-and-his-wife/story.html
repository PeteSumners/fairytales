        <div class="story-content">
            <p>There was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close</p>
<p>by the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and</p>
<p>one day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling</p>
<p>waves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was dragged away</p>
<p>deep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish.</p>
<p>But the fish said, ‘Pray let me live! I am not a real fish; I am an</p>
<p>enchanted prince: put me in the water again, and let me go!’ ‘Oh, ho!’</p>
<p>said the man, ‘you need not make so many words about the matter; I will</p>
<p>have nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so swim away, sir, as soon</p>
<p>as you please!’ Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted</p>
<p>straight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him</p>
<p>on the wave.</p>
<p>When the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty, he told her how</p>
<p>he had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted</p>
<p>prince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go again. ‘Did not</p>
<p>you ask it for anything?’ said the wife, ‘we live very wretchedly here,</p>
<p>in this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug</p>
<p>little cottage.’</p>
<p>The fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the</p>
<p>seashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and</p>
<p>green. And he stood at the water’s edge, and said:</p>
<p>‘O man of the sea!</p>
<p>Hearken to me!</p>
<p>My wife Ilsabill</p>
<p>Will have her own will,</p>
<p>And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’</p>
<p>Then the fish came swimming to him, and said, ‘Well, what is her will?</p>
<p>What does your wife want?’ ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘she says that when</p>
<p>I had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let</p>
<p>you go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants</p>
<p>a snug little cottage.’ ‘Go home, then,’ said the fish; ‘she is in the</p>
<p>cottage already!’ So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the</p>
<p>door of a nice trim little cottage. ‘Come in, come in!’ said she; ‘is</p>
<p>not this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?’ And there was a</p>
<p>parlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there</p>
<p>was a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and</p>
<p>there was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens. ‘Ah!’ said the</p>
<p>fisherman, ‘how happily we shall live now!’ ‘We will try to do so, at</p>
<p>least,’ said his wife.</p>
<p>Everything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill said,</p>
<p>‘Husband, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the</p>
<p>courtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; I should like to</p>
<p>have a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him</p>
<p>to give us a castle.’ ‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘I don’t like to go to</p>
<p>him again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this</p>
<p>pretty cottage to live in.’ ‘Nonsense!’ said the wife; ‘he will do it</p>
<p>very willingly, I know; go along and try!’</p>
<p>The fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to</p>
<p>the sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he went</p>
<p>close to the edge of the waves, and said:</p>
<p>‘O man of the sea!</p>
<p>Hearken to me!</p>
<p>My wife Ilsabill</p>
<p>Will have her own will,</p>
<p>And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’</p>
<p>‘Well, what does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the man,</p>
<p>dolefully, ‘my wife wants to live in a stone castle.’ ‘Go home, then,’</p>
<p>said the fish; ‘she is standing at the gate of it already.’ So away went</p>
<p>the fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great</p>
<p>castle. ‘See,’ said she, ‘is not this grand?’ With that they went into</p>
<p>the castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the</p>
<p>rooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and</p>
<p>behind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a</p>
<p>mile long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the</p>
<p>courtyard were stables and cow-houses. ‘Well,’ said the man, ‘now we</p>
<p>will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of</p>
<p>our lives.’ ‘Perhaps we may,’ said the wife; ‘but let us sleep upon it,</p>
<p>before we make up our minds to that.’ So they went to bed.</p>
<p>The next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and</p>
<p>she jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, ‘Get up, husband,</p>
<p>and bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land.’ ‘Wife, wife,’</p>
<p>said the man, ‘why should we wish to be the king? I will not be king.’</p>
<p>‘Then I will,’ said she. ‘But, wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘how can you</p>
<p>be king--the fish cannot make you a king?’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘say</p>
<p>no more about it, but go and try! I will be king.’ So the man went away</p>
<p>quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. This time</p>
<p>the sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves</p>
<p>and the ridges of foam as he cried out:</p>
<p>‘O man of the sea!</p>
<p>Hearken to me!</p>
<p>My wife Ilsabill</p>
<p>Will have her own will,</p>
<p>And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’</p>
<p>‘Well, what would she have now?’ said the fish. ‘Alas!’ said the poor</p>
<p>man, ‘my wife wants to be king.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is king</p>
<p>already.’</p>
<p>Then the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw</p>
<p>a troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. And when</p>
<p>he went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds,</p>
<p>with a golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her stood six</p>
<p>fair maidens, each a head taller than the other. ‘Well, wife,’ said the</p>
<p>fisherman, ‘are you king?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am king.’ And when he had</p>
<p>looked at her for a long time, he said, ‘Ah, wife! what a fine thing it</p>
<p>is to be king! Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long</p>
<p>as we live.’ ‘I don’t know how that may be,’ said she; ‘never is a long</p>
<p>time. I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I</p>
<p>think I should like to be emperor.’ ‘Alas, wife! why should you wish to</p>
<p>be emperor?’ said the fisherman. ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘go to the fish!</p>
<p>I say I will be emperor.’ ‘Ah, wife!’ replied the fisherman, ‘the fish</p>
<p>cannot make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for</p>
<p>such a thing.’ ‘I am king,’ said Ilsabill, ‘and you are my slave; so go</p>
<p>at once!’</p>
<p>So the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along,</p>
<p>‘This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be</p>
<p>tired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.’ He</p>
<p>soon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and</p>
<p>a mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he</p>
<p>went as near as he could to the water’s brink, and said:</p>
<p>‘O man of the sea!</p>
<p>Hearken to me!</p>
<p>My wife Ilsabill</p>
<p>Will have her own will,</p>
<p>And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’</p>
<p>‘What would she have now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman,</p>
<p>‘she wants to be emperor.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is emperor</p>
<p>already.’</p>
<p>So he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill</p>
<p>sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on</p>
<p>her head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards</p>
<p>and attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the</p>
<p>tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. And</p>
<p>before her stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the fisherman went</p>
<p>up to her and said, ‘Wife, are you emperor?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am</p>
<p>emperor.’ ‘Ah!’ said the man, as he gazed upon her, ‘what a fine thing</p>
<p>it is to be emperor!’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘why should we stop at being</p>
<p>emperor? I will be pope next.’ ‘O wife, wife!’ said he, ‘how can you be</p>
<p>pope? there is but one pope at a time in Christendom.’ ‘Husband,’ said</p>
<p>she, ‘I will be pope this very day.’ ‘But,’ replied the husband, ‘the</p>
<p>fish cannot make you pope.’ ‘What nonsense!’ said she; ‘if he can make</p>
<p>an emperor, he can make a pope: go and try him.’</p>
<p>So the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind was raging</p>
<p>and the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves, and the ships were</p>
<p>in trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows. In the</p>
<p>middle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky, but towards</p>
<p>the south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising. At this sight</p>
<p>the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his</p>
<p>knees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and</p>
<p>said:</p>
<p>‘O man of the sea!</p>
<p>Hearken to me!</p>
<p>My wife Ilsabill</p>
<p>Will have her own will,</p>
<p>And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’</p>
<p>‘What does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘my</p>
<p>wife wants to be pope.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is pope already.’</p>
<p>Then the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill sitting on a throne</p>
<p>that was two miles high. And she had three great crowns on her head, and</p>
<p>around her stood all the pomp and power of the Church. And on each side</p>
<p>of her were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the greatest as</p>
<p>large as the highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no</p>
<p>larger than a small rushlight. ‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, as he looked</p>
<p>at all this greatness, ‘are you pope?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am pope.’</p>
<p>‘Well, wife,’ replied he, ‘it is a grand thing to be pope; and now</p>
<p>you must be easy, for you can be nothing greater.’ ‘I will think about</p>
<p>that,’ said the wife. Then they went to bed: but Dame Ilsabill could not</p>
<p>sleep all night for thinking what she should be next. At last, as she</p>
<p>was dropping asleep, morning broke, and the sun rose. ‘Ha!’ thought she,</p>
<p>as she woke up and looked at it through the window, ‘after all I cannot</p>
<p>prevent the sun rising.’ At this thought she was very angry, and wakened</p>
<p>her husband, and said, ‘Husband, go to the fish and tell him I must</p>
<p>be lord of the sun and moon.’ The fisherman was half asleep, but the</p>
<p>thought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed.</p>
<p>‘Alas, wife!’ said he, ‘cannot you be easy with being pope?’ ‘No,’</p>
<p>said she, ‘I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my</p>
<p>leave. Go to the fish at once!’</p>
<p>Then the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to</p>
<p>the shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks</p>
<p>shook. And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds, and the</p>
<p>lightnings played, and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in</p>
<p>the sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of</p>
<p>white foam upon their heads. And the fisherman crept towards the sea,</p>
<p>and cried out, as well as he could:</p>
<p>‘O man of the sea!</p>
<p>Hearken to me!</p>
<p>My wife Ilsabill</p>
<p>Will have her own will,</p>
<p>And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’</p>
<p>‘What does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘she wants to</p>
<p>be lord of the sun and moon.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish, ‘to your pigsty</p>
<p>again.’</p>
<p>And there they live to this very day.</p>
