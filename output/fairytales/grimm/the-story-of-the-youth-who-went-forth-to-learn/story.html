        <div class="story-content">
            <p>A certain father had two sons, the elder of who was smart and sensible,</p>
<p>and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither</p>
<p>learn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said:</p>
<p>‘There’s a fellow who will give his father some trouble!’ When anything</p>
<p>had to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but</p>
<p>if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the</p>
<p>night-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal</p>
<p>place, he answered: ‘Oh, no father, I’ll not go there, it makes me</p>
<p>shudder!’ for he was afraid. Or when stories were told by the fire at</p>
<p>night which made the flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said: ‘Oh,</p>
<p>it makes us shudder!’ The younger sat in a corner and listened with</p>
<p>the rest of them, and could not imagine what they could mean. ‘They are</p>
<p>always saying: “It makes me shudder, it makes me shudder!” It does not</p>
<p>make me shudder,’ thought he. ‘That, too, must be an art of which I</p>
<p>understand nothing!’</p>
<p>Now it came to pass that his father said to him one day: ‘Hearken to me,</p>
<p>you fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong, and you</p>
<p>too must learn something by which you can earn your bread. Look how your</p>
<p>brother works, but you do not even earn your salt.’ ‘Well, father,’ he</p>
<p>replied, ‘I am quite willing to learn something--indeed, if it could but</p>
<p>be managed, I should like to learn how to shudder. I don’t understand</p>
<p>that at all yet.’ The elder brother smiled when he heard that, and</p>
<p>thought to himself: ‘Goodness, what a blockhead that brother of mine is!</p>
<p>He will never be good for anything as long as he lives! He who wants to</p>
<p>be a sickle must bend himself betimes.’</p>
<p>The father sighed, and answered him: ‘You shall soon learn what it is to</p>
<p>shudder, but you will not earn your bread by that.’</p>
<p>Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the father</p>
<p>bewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backward</p>
<p>in every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing. ‘Just think,’</p>
<p>said he, ‘when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he</p>
<p>actually wanted to learn to shudder.’ ‘If that be all,’ replied the</p>
<p>sexton, ‘he can learn that with me. Send him to me, and I will soon</p>
<p>polish him.’ The father was glad to do it, for he thought: ‘It will</p>
<p>train the boy a little.’ The sexton therefore took him into his house,</p>
<p>and he had to ring the church bell. After a day or two, the sexton awoke</p>
<p>him at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into the church tower and</p>
<p>ring the bell. ‘You shall soon learn what shuddering is,’ thought he,</p>
<p>and secretly went there before him; and when the boy was at the top of</p>
<p>the tower and turned round, and was just going to take hold of the bell</p>
<p>rope, he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding</p>
<p>hole. ‘Who is there?’ cried he, but the figure made no reply, and did</p>
<p>not move or stir. ‘Give an answer,’ cried the boy, ‘or take yourself</p>
<p>off, you have no business here at night.’</p>
<p>The sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might</p>
<p>think he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time: ‘What do you want</p>
<p>here?--speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the</p>
<p>steps!’ The sexton thought: ‘He can’t mean to be as bad as his words,’</p>
<p>uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boy</p>
<p>called to him for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose,</p>
<p>he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell</p>
<p>down the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon he</p>
<p>rang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went to bed, and</p>
<p>fell asleep. The sexton’s wife waited a long time for her husband, but</p>
<p>he did not come back. At length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy,</p>
<p>and asked: ‘Do you know where my husband is? He climbed up the tower</p>
<p>before you did.’ ‘No, I don’t know,’ replied the boy, ‘but someone was</p>
<p>standing by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps, and as he</p>
<p>would neither give an answer nor go away, I took him for a scoundrel,</p>
<p>and threw him downstairs. Just go there and you will see if it was he.</p>
<p>I should be sorry if it were.’ The woman ran away and found her husband,</p>
<p>who was lying moaning in the corner, and had broken his leg.</p>
<p>She carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the</p>
<p>boy’s father, ‘Your boy,’ cried she, ‘has been the cause of a great</p>
<p>misfortune! He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his</p>
<p>leg. Take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.’ The father was</p>
<p>terrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy. ‘What wicked tricks</p>
<p>are these?’ said he. ‘The devil must have put them into your head.’</p>
<p>‘Father,’ he replied, ‘do listen to me. I am quite innocent. He was</p>
<p>standing there by night like one intent on doing evil. I did not know</p>
<p>who it was, and I entreated him three times either to speak or to go</p>
<p>away.’ ‘Ah,’ said the father, ‘I have nothing but unhappiness with you.</p>
<p>Go out of my sight. I will see you no more.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day. Then will I</p>
<p>go forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate,</p>
<p>understand one art which will support me.’ ‘Learn what you will,’ spoke</p>
<p>the father, ‘it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers for you.</p>
<p>Take these and go into the wide world, and tell no one from whence you</p>
<p>come, and who is your father, for I have reason to be ashamed of you.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, father, it shall be as you will. If you desire nothing more than</p>
<p>that, I can easily keep it in mind.’</p>
<p>When the day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into his</p>
<p>pocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to</p>
<p>himself: ‘If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!’ Then a man</p>
<p>approached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with</p>
<p>himself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could</p>
<p>see the gallows, the man said to him: ‘Look, there is the tree where</p>
<p>seven men have married the ropemaker’s daughter, and are now learning</p>
<p>how to fly. Sit down beneath it, and wait till night comes, and you will</p>
<p>soon learn how to shudder.’ ‘If that is all that is wanted,’ answered</p>
<p>the youth, ‘it is easily done; but if I learn how to shudder as fast as</p>
<p>that, you shall have my fifty talers. Just come back to me early in the</p>
<p>morning.’ Then the youth went to the gallows, sat down beneath it, and</p>
<p>waited till evening came. And as he was cold, he lighted himself a fire,</p>
<p>but at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire, he</p>
<p>could not get warm. And as the wind knocked the hanged men against each</p>
<p>other, and they moved backwards and forwards, he thought to himself:</p>
<p>‘If you shiver below by the fire, how those up above must freeze and</p>
<p>suffer!’ And as he felt pity for them, he raised the ladder, and climbed</p>
<p>up, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven.</p>
<p>Then he stoked the fire, blew it, and set them all round it to warm</p>
<p>themselves. But they sat there and did not stir, and the fire caught</p>
<p>their clothes. So he said: ‘Take care, or I will hang you up again.’ The</p>
<p>dead men, however, did not hear, but were quite silent, and let their</p>
<p>rags go on burning. At this he grew angry, and said: ‘If you will not</p>
<p>take care, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with you,’ and he hung</p>
<p>them up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his fire and fell</p>
<p>asleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have</p>
<p>the fifty talers, and said: ‘Well do you know how to shudder?’ ‘No,’</p>
<p>answered he, ‘how should I know? Those fellows up there did not open</p>
<p>their mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which</p>
<p>they had on their bodies get burnt.’ Then the man saw that he would not</p>
<p>get the fifty talers that day, and went away saying: ‘Such a youth has</p>
<p>never come my way before.’</p>
<p>The youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to</p>
<p>himself: ‘Ah, if I could but shudder! Ah, if I could but shudder!’ A</p>
<p>waggoner who was striding behind him heard this and asked: ‘Who are</p>
<p>you?’ ‘I don’t know,’ answered the youth. Then the waggoner asked: ‘From</p>
<p>whence do you come?’ ‘I know not.’ ‘Who is your father?’ ‘That I may</p>
<p>not tell you.’ ‘What is it that you are always muttering between your</p>
<p>teeth?’ ‘Ah,’ replied the youth, ‘I do so wish I could shudder, but</p>
<p>no one can teach me how.’ ‘Enough of your foolish chatter,’ said the</p>
<p>waggoner. ‘Come, go with me, I will see about a place for you.’ The</p>
<p>youth went with the waggoner, and in the evening they arrived at an inn</p>
<p>where they wished to pass the night. Then at the entrance of the parlour</p>
<p>the youth again said quite loudly: ‘If I could but shudder! If I could</p>
<p>but shudder!’ The host who heard this, laughed and said: ‘If that is</p>
<p>your desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.’ ‘Ah,</p>
<p>be silent,’ said the hostess, ‘so many prying persons have already lost</p>
<p>their lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as</p>
<p>these should never see the daylight again.’</p>
<p>But the youth said: ‘However difficult it may be, I will learn it. For</p>
<p>this purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.’ He let the host have</p>
<p>no rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a</p>
<p>haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was,</p>
<p>if he would but watch in it for three nights. The king had promised that</p>
<p>he who would venture should have his daughter to wife, and she was the</p>
<p>most beautiful maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in the castle lay great</p>
<p>treasures, which were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would</p>
<p>then be freed, and would make a poor man rich enough. Already many men</p>
<p>had gone into the castle, but as yet none had come out again. Then the</p>
<p>youth went next morning to the king, and said: ‘If it be allowed, I will</p>
<p>willingly watch three nights in the haunted castle.’</p>
<p>The king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said: ‘You may</p>
<p>ask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must</p>
<p>be things without life.’ Then he answered: ‘Then I ask for a fire, a</p>
<p>turning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.’</p>
<p>The king had these things carried into the castle for him during the</p>
<p>day. When night was drawing near, the youth went up and made himself</p>
<p>a bright fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife</p>
<p>beside it, and seated himself by the turning-lathe. ‘Ah, if I could</p>
<p>but shudder!’ said he, ‘but I shall not learn it here either.’ Towards</p>
<p>midnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it,</p>
<p>something cried suddenly from one corner: ‘Au, miau! how cold we are!’</p>
<p>‘You fools!’ cried he, ‘what are you crying about? If you are cold, come</p>
<p>and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.’ And when he had said</p>
<p>that, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down</p>
<p>on each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery</p>
<p>eyes. After a short time, when they had warmed themselves, they said:</p>
<p>‘Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?’ ‘Why not?’ he replied, ‘but</p>
<p>just show me your paws.’ Then they stretched out their claws. ‘Oh,’ said</p>
<p>he, ‘what long nails you have! Wait, I must first cut them for you.’</p>
<p>Thereupon he seized them by the throats, put them on the cutting-board</p>
<p>and screwed their feet fast. ‘I have looked at your fingers,’ said he,</p>
<p>‘and my fancy for card-playing has gone,’ and he struck them dead and</p>
<p>threw them out into the water. But when he had made away with these two,</p>
<p>and was about to sit down again by his fire, out from every hole and</p>
<p>corner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains, and more</p>
<p>and more of them came until he could no longer move, and they yelled</p>
<p>horribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to put</p>
<p>it out. He watched them for a while quietly, but at last when they were</p>
<p>going too far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried: ‘Away with you,</p>
<p>vermin,’ and began to cut them down. Some of them ran away, the others</p>
<p>he killed, and threw out into the fish-pond. When he came back he fanned</p>
<p>the embers of his fire again and warmed himself. And as he thus sat, his</p>
<p>eyes would keep open no longer, and he felt a desire to sleep. Then he</p>
<p>looked round and saw a great bed in the corner. ‘That is the very thing</p>
<p>for me,’ said he, and got into it. When he was just going to shut his</p>
<p>eyes, however, the bed began to move of its own accord, and went over</p>
<p>the whole of the castle. ‘That’s right,’ said he, ‘but go faster.’ Then</p>
<p>the bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down,</p>
<p>over thresholds and stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside</p>
<p>down, and lay on him like a mountain. But he threw quilts and pillows up</p>
<p>in the air, got out and said: ‘Now anyone who likes, may drive,’ and</p>
<p>lay down by his fire, and slept till it was day. In the morning the king</p>
<p>came, and when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the evil</p>
<p>spirits had killed him and he was dead. Then said he: ‘After all it is a</p>
<p>pity,--for so handsome a man.’ The youth heard it, got up, and said: ‘It</p>
<p>has not come to that yet.’ Then the king was astonished, but very glad,</p>
<p>and asked how he had fared. ‘Very well indeed,’ answered he; ‘one</p>
<p>night is past, the two others will pass likewise.’ Then he went to the</p>
<p>innkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said: ‘I never expected to</p>
<p>see you alive again! Have you learnt how to shudder yet?’ ‘No,’ said he,</p>
<p>‘it is all in vain. If someone would but tell me!’</p>
<p>The second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by the</p>
<p>fire, and once more began his old song: ‘If I could but shudder!’ When</p>
<p>midnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at</p>
<p>first it was low, but it grew louder and louder. Then it was quiet for</p>
<p>a while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the</p>
<p>chimney and fell before him. ‘Hullo!’ cried he, ‘another half belongs</p>
<p>to this. This is not enough!’ Then the uproar began again, there was a</p>
<p>roaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise. ‘Wait,’ said</p>
<p>he, ‘I will just stoke up the fire a little for you.’ When he had done</p>
<p>that and looked round again, the two pieces were joined together, and a</p>
<p>hideous man was sitting in his place. ‘That is no part of our bargain,’</p>
<p>said the youth, ‘the bench is mine.’ The man wanted to push him away;</p>
<p>the youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him off with all</p>
<p>his strength, and seated himself again in his own place. Then still more</p>
<p>men fell down, one after the other; they brought nine dead men’s legs</p>
<p>and two skulls, and set them up and played at nine-pins with them. The</p>
<p>youth also wanted to play and said: ‘Listen you, can I join you?’ ‘Yes,</p>
<p>if you have any money.’ ‘Money enough,’ replied he, ‘but your balls are</p>
<p>not quite round.’ Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and</p>
<p>turned them till they were round. ‘There, now they will roll better!’</p>
<p>said he. ‘Hurrah! now we’ll have fun!’ He played with them and lost some</p>
<p>of his money, but when it struck twelve, everything vanished from his</p>
<p>sight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep. Next morning the king came</p>
<p>to inquire after him. ‘How has it fared with you this time?’ asked he.</p>
<p>‘I have been playing at nine-pins,’ he answered, ‘and have lost a couple</p>
<p>of farthings.’ ‘Have you not shuddered then?’ ‘What?’ said he, ‘I have</p>
<p>had a wonderful time! If I did but know what it was to shudder!’</p>
<p>The third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly:</p>
<p>‘If I could but shudder.’ When it grew late, six tall men came in and</p>
<p>brought a coffin. Then he said: ‘Ha, ha, that is certainly my little</p>
<p>cousin, who died only a few days ago,’ and he beckoned with his finger,</p>
<p>and cried: ‘Come, little cousin, come.’ They placed the coffin on the</p>
<p>ground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay</p>
<p>therein. He felt his face, but it was cold as ice. ‘Wait,’ said he, ‘I</p>
<p>will warm you a little,’ and went to the fire and warmed his hand and</p>
<p>laid it on the dead man’s face, but he remained cold. Then he took him</p>
<p>out, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his</p>
<p>arms that the blood might circulate again. As this also did no good, he</p>
<p>thought to himself: ‘When two people lie in bed together, they warm each</p>
<p>other,’ and carried him to the bed, covered him over and lay down by</p>
<p>him. After a short time the dead man became warm too, and began to move.</p>
<p>Then said the youth, ‘See, little cousin, have I not warmed you?’ The</p>
<p>dead man, however, got up and cried: ‘Now will I strangle you.’</p>
<p>‘What!’ said he, ‘is that the way you thank me? You shall at once go</p>
<p>into your coffin again,’ and he took him up, threw him into it, and shut</p>
<p>the lid. Then came the six men and carried him away again. ‘I cannot</p>
<p>manage to shudder,’ said he. ‘I shall never learn it here as long as I</p>
<p>live.’</p>
<p>Then a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible.</p>
<p>He was old, however, and had a long white beard. ‘You wretch,’ cried he,</p>
<p>‘you shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for you shall die.’ ‘Not so</p>
<p>fast,’ replied the youth. ‘If I am to die, I shall have to have a say</p>
<p>in it.’ ‘I will soon seize you,’ said the fiend. ‘Softly, softly, do not</p>
<p>talk so big. I am as strong as you are, and perhaps even stronger.’</p>
<p>‘We shall see,’ said the old man. ‘If you are stronger, I will let you</p>
<p>go--come, we will try.’ Then he led him by dark passages to a smith’s</p>
<p>forge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground.</p>
<p>‘I can do better than that,’ said the youth, and went to the other</p>
<p>anvil. The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his</p>
<p>white beard hung down. Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil</p>
<p>with one blow, and in it caught the old man’s beard. ‘Now I have you,’</p>
<p>said the youth. ‘Now it is your turn to die.’ Then he seized an iron bar</p>
<p>and beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop, when he</p>
<p>would give him great riches. The youth drew out the axe and let him go.</p>
<p>The old man led him back into the castle, and in a cellar showed him</p>
<p>three chests full of gold. ‘Of these,’ said he, ‘one part is for the</p>
<p>poor, the other for the king, the third yours.’ In the meantime it</p>
<p>struck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so that the youth stood in</p>
<p>darkness. ‘I shall still be able to find my way out,’ said he, and felt</p>
<p>about, found the way into the room, and slept there by his fire.</p>
<p>Next morning the king came and said: ‘Now you must have learnt what</p>
<p>shuddering is?’ ‘No,’ he answered; ‘what can it be? My dead cousin was</p>
<p>here, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down</p>
<p>below, but no one told me what it was to shudder.’ ‘Then,’ said the</p>
<p>king, ‘you have saved the castle, and shall marry my daughter.’ ‘That</p>
<p>is all very well,’ said he, ‘but still I do not know what it is to</p>
<p>shudder!’</p>
<p>Then the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever</p>
<p>much the young king loved his wife, and however happy he was, he still</p>
<p>said always: ‘If I could but shudder--if I could but shudder.’ And this</p>
<p>at last angered her. Her waiting-maid said: ‘I will find a cure for him;</p>
<p>he shall soon learn what it is to shudder.’ She went out to the stream</p>
<p>which flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons</p>
<p>brought to her. At night when the young king was sleeping, his wife was</p>
<p>to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold water</p>
<p>with the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes would</p>
<p>sprawl about him. Then he woke up and cried: ‘Oh, what makes me shudder</p>
<p>so?--what makes me shudder so, dear wife? Ah! now I know what it is to</p>
<p>shudder!’</p>
