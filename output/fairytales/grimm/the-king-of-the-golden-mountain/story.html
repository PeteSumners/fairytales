            <p>There was once a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very</p>
<p>young, and barely able to run alone. He had two richly laden ships then</p>
<p>making a voyage upon the seas, in which he had embarked all his wealth,</p>
<p>in the hope of making great gains, when the news came that both were</p>
<p>lost. Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor that</p>
<p>nothing was left to him but one small plot of land; and there he often</p>
<p>went in an evening to take his walk, and ease his mind of a little of</p>
<p>his trouble.</p>
<p>One day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no</p>
<p>great comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like</p>
<p>to be, all on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking,</p>
<p>black dwarf. ‘Prithee, friend, why so sorrowful?’ said he to the</p>
<p>merchant; ‘what is it you take so deeply to heart?’ ‘If you would do me</p>
<p>any good I would willingly tell you,’ said the merchant. ‘Who knows but</p>
<p>I may?’ said the little man: ‘tell me what ails you, and perhaps you</p>
<p>will find I may be of some use.’ Then the merchant told him how all his</p>
<p>wealth was gone to the bottom of the sea, and how he had nothing left</p>
<p>but that little plot of land. ‘Oh, trouble not yourself about that,’</p>
<p>said the dwarf; ‘only undertake to bring me here, twelve years hence,</p>
<p>whatever meets you first on your going home, and I will give you as much</p>
<p>as you please.’ The merchant thought this was no great thing to ask;</p>
<p>that it would most likely be his dog or his cat, or something of that</p>
<p>sort, but forgot his little boy Heinel; so he agreed to the bargain, and</p>
<p>signed and sealed the bond to do what was asked of him.</p>
<p>But as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he</p>
<p>crept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in</p>
<p>his face and laughed. Then the father started, trembling with fear and</p>
<p>horror, and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no</p>
<p>gold was come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke</p>
<p>that the dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the money</p>
<p>came, he should see the bearer, and would not take it in.</p>
<p>About a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber-room to look</p>
<p>for some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money; and</p>
<p>there, instead of his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the</p>
<p>floor. At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about</p>
<p>his son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>Meantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years drew</p>
<p>near the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very sad</p>
<p>and thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face. The</p>
<p>boy one day asked what was the matter, but his father would not tell for</p>
<p>some time; at last, however, he said that he had, without knowing it,</p>
<p>sold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the</p>
<p>twelve years were coming round when he must keep his word. Then Heinel</p>
<p>said, ‘Father, give yourself very little trouble about that; I shall be</p>
<p>too much for the little man.’</p>
<p>When the time came, the father and son went out together to the place</p>
<p>agreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself</p>
<p>and his father in the middle of it. The little black dwarf soon came,</p>
<p>and walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any way</p>
<p>to get into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over it. At</p>
<p>last the boy said to him. ‘Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or</p>
<p>what do you want?’ Now Heinel had found a friend in a good fairy, that</p>
<p>was fond of him, and had told him what to do; for this fairy knew what</p>
<p>good luck was in store for him. ‘Have you brought me what you said you</p>
<p>would?’ said the dwarf to the merchant. The old man held his tongue, but</p>
<p>Heinel said again, ‘What do you want here?’ The dwarf said, ‘I come to</p>
<p>talk with your father, not with you.’ ‘You have cheated and taken in my</p>
<p>father,’ said the son; ‘pray give him up his bond at once.’ ‘Fair and</p>
<p>softly,’ said the little old man; ‘right is right; I have paid my money,</p>
<p>and your father has had it, and spent it; so be so good as to let me</p>
<p>have what I paid it for.’ ‘You must have my consent to that first,’ said</p>
<p>Heinel, ‘so please to step in here, and let us talk it over.’ The old</p>
<p>man grinned, and showed his teeth, as if he should have been very glad</p>
<p>to get into the circle if he could. Then at last, after a long talk,</p>
<p>they came to terms. Heinel agreed that his father must give him up, and</p>
<p>that so far the dwarf should have his way: but, on the other hand, the</p>
<p>fairy had told Heinel what fortune was in store for him, if he followed</p>
<p>his own course; and he did not choose to be given up to his hump-backed</p>
<p>friend, who seemed so anxious for his company.</p>
<p>So, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that</p>
<p>Heinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard</p>
<p>by; that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he</p>
<p>should thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind and</p>
<p>weather. Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat,</p>
<p>but before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side</p>
<p>low in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and</p>
<p>went home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at</p>
<p>any rate he had had his revenge.</p>
<p>The boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her</p>
<p>friend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on. The</p>
<p>young man sat safe within, till at length it ran ashore upon an unknown</p>
<p>land. As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castle</p>
<p>but empty and dreary within, for it was enchanted. ‘Here,’ said he to</p>
<p>himself, ‘must I find the prize the good fairy told me of.’ So he once</p>
<p>more searched the whole palace through, till at last he found a white</p>
<p>snake, lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers.</p>
<p>Now the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad</p>
<p>to see him, and said, ‘Are you at last come to set me free? Twelve</p>
<p>long years have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as she</p>
<p>promised, for you alone can save me. This night twelve men will come:</p>
<p>their faces will be black, and they will be dressed in chain armour.</p>
<p>They will ask what you do here, but give no answer; and let them do</p>
<p>what they will--beat, whip, pinch, prick, or torment you--bear all; only</p>
<p>speak not a word, and at twelve o’clock they must go away. The second</p>
<p>night twelve others will come: and the third night twenty-four, who</p>
<p>will even cut off your head; but at the twelfth hour of that night their</p>
<p>power is gone, and I shall be free, and will come and bring you the</p>
<p>Water of Life, and will wash you with it, and bring you back to life</p>
<p>and health.’ And all came to pass as she had said; Heinel bore all, and</p>
<p>spoke not a word; and the third night the princess came, and fell on his</p>
<p>neck and kissed him. Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle,</p>
<p>the wedding was celebrated, and he was crowned king of the Golden</p>
<p>Mountain.</p>
<p>They lived together very happily, and the queen had a son. And thus</p>
<p>eight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his</p>
<p>father; and he began to long to see him once again. But the queen was</p>
<p>against his going, and said, ‘I know well that misfortunes will come</p>
<p>upon us if you go.’ However, he gave her no rest till she agreed. At his</p>
<p>going away she gave him a wishing-ring, and said, ‘Take this ring, and</p>
<p>put it on your finger; whatever you wish it will bring you; only promise</p>
<p>never to make use of it to bring me hence to your father’s house.’ Then</p>
<p>he said he would do what she asked, and put the ring on his finger, and</p>
<p>wished himself near the town where his father lived.</p>
<p>Heinel found himself at the gates in a moment; but the guards would</p>
<p>not let him go in, because he was so strangely clad. So he went up to a</p>
<p>neighbouring hill, where a shepherd dwelt, and borrowed his old frock,</p>
<p>and thus passed unknown into the town. When he came to his father’s</p>
<p>house, he said he was his son; but the merchant would not believe him,</p>
<p>and said he had had but one son, his poor Heinel, who he knew was long</p>
<p>since dead: and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd, he would</p>
<p>not even give him anything to eat. The king, however, still vowed that</p>
<p>he was his son, and said, ‘Is there no mark by which you would know me</p>
<p>if I am really your son?’ ‘Yes,’ said his mother, ‘our Heinel had a mark</p>
<p>like a raspberry on his right arm.’ Then he showed them the mark, and</p>
<p>they knew that what he had said was true.</p>
<p>He next told them how he was king of the Golden Mountain, and was</p>
<p>married to a princess, and had a son seven years old. But the merchant</p>
<p>said, ‘that can never be true; he must be a fine king truly who travels</p>
<p>about in a shepherd’s frock!’ At this the son was vexed; and forgetting</p>
<p>his word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son. In an</p>
<p>instant they stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had</p>
<p>broken his word, and bad luck would follow. He did all he could to</p>
<p>soothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in</p>
<p>truth, and was only thinking how she should punish him.</p>
<p>One day he took her to walk with him out of the town, and showed her</p>
<p>the spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then he sat</p>
<p>himself down, and said, ‘I am very much tired; sit by me, I will rest my</p>
<p>head in your lap, and sleep a while.’ As soon as he had fallen asleep,</p>
<p>however, she drew the ring from his finger, and crept softly away, and</p>
<p>wished herself and her son at home in their kingdom. And when he awoke</p>
<p>he found himself alone, and saw that the ring was gone from his finger.</p>
<p>‘I can never go back to my father’s house,’ said he; ‘they would say I</p>
<p>am a sorcerer: I will journey forth into the world, till I come again to</p>
<p>my kingdom.’</p>
<p>So saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill, where three</p>
<p>giants were sharing their father’s goods; and as they saw him pass they</p>
<p>cried out and said, ‘Little men have sharp wits; he shall part the goods</p>
<p>between us.’ Now there was a sword that cut off an enemy’s head whenever</p>
<p>the wearer gave the words, ‘Heads off!’; a cloak that made the owner</p>
<p>invisible, or gave him any form he pleased; and a pair of boots that</p>
<p>carried the wearer wherever he wished. Heinel said they must first let</p>
<p>him try these wonderful things, then he might know how to set a value</p>
<p>upon them. Then they gave him the cloak, and he wished himself a fly,</p>
<p>and in a moment he was a fly. ‘The cloak is very well,’ said he: ‘now</p>
<p>give me the sword.’ ‘No,’ said they; ‘not unless you undertake not to</p>
<p>say, “Heads off!” for if you do we are all dead men.’ So they gave it</p>
<p>him, charging him to try it on a tree. He next asked for the boots also;</p>
<p>and the moment he had all three in his power, he wished himself at</p>
<p>the Golden Mountain; and there he was at once. So the giants were left</p>
<p>behind with no goods to share or quarrel about.</p>
<p>As Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music; and</p>
<p>the people around told him that his queen was about to marry another</p>
<p>husband. Then he threw his cloak around him, and passed through the</p>
<p>castle hall, and placed himself by the side of the queen, where no one</p>
<p>saw him. But when anything to eat was put upon her plate, he took it</p>
<p>away and ate it himself; and when a glass of wine was handed to her, he</p>
<p>took it and drank it; and thus, though they kept on giving her meat and</p>
<p>drink, her plate and cup were always empty.</p>
<p>Upon this, fear and remorse came over her, and she went into her chamber</p>
<p>alone, and sat there weeping; and he followed her there. ‘Alas!’ said</p>
<p>she to herself, ‘was I not once set free? Why then does this enchantment</p>
<p>still seem to bind me?’</p>
<p>‘False and fickle one!’ said he. ‘One indeed came who set thee free, and</p>
<p>he is now near thee again; but how have you used him? Ought he to</p>
<p>have had such treatment from thee?’ Then he went out and sent away the</p>
<p>company, and said the wedding was at an end, for that he was come back</p>
<p>to the kingdom. But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at him.</p>
<p>However, he would enter into no parley with them, but only asked them</p>
<p>if they would go in peace or not. Then they turned upon him and tried</p>
<p>to seize him; but he drew his sword. ‘Heads Off!’ cried he; and with the</p>
<p>word the traitors’ heads fell before him, and Heinel was once more king</p>
<p>of the Golden Mountain.</p>
