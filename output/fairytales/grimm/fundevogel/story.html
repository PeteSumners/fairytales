            <p>There was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as</p>
<p>he entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were</p>
<p>there. He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree, and at</p>
<p>the top of this a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallen</p>
<p>asleep under the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen it in</p>
<p>her arms, had flown down, snatched it away, and set it on the high tree.</p>
<p>The forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to himself:</p>
<p>‘You will take him home with you, and bring him up with your Lina.’ He</p>
<p>took it home, therefore, and the two children grew up together. And the</p>
<p>one, which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel, because a bird</p>
<p>had carried it away. Fundevogel and Lina loved each other so dearly that</p>
<p>when they did not see each other they were sad.</p>
<p>Now the forester had an old cook, who one evening took two pails and</p>
<p>began to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out</p>
<p>to the spring. Lina saw this and said, ‘Listen, old Sanna, why are you</p>
<p>fetching so much water?’ ‘If you will never repeat it to anyone, I will</p>
<p>tell you why.’ So Lina said, no, she would never repeat it to anyone,</p>
<p>and then the cook said: ‘Early tomorrow morning, when the forester</p>
<p>is out hunting, I will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the</p>
<p>kettle, I will throw in Fundevogel, and will boil him in it.’</p>
<p>Early next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and when he</p>
<p>was gone the children were still in bed. Then Lina said to Fundevogel:</p>
<p>‘If you will never leave me, I too will never leave you.’ Fundevogel</p>
<p>said: ‘Neither now, nor ever will I leave you.’ Then said Lina: ‘Then</p>
<p>will I tell you. Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water</p>
<p>into the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said</p>
<p>that if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early</p>
<p>tomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle</p>
<p>full of water, throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up</p>
<p>quickly, dress ourselves, and go away together.’</p>
<p>The two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly, and went</p>
<p>away. When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the</p>
<p>bedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it. But when she came in,</p>
<p>and went to the beds, both the children were gone. Then she was terribly</p>
<p>alarmed, and she said to herself: ‘What shall I say now when the</p>
<p>forester comes home and sees that the children are gone? They must be</p>
<p>followed instantly to get them back again.’</p>
<p>Then the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and</p>
<p>overtake the children. The children, however, were sitting outside the</p>
<p>forest, and when they saw from afar the three servants running, Lina</p>
<p>said to Fundevogel: ‘Never leave me, and I will never leave you.’</p>
<p>Fundevogel said: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’ Then said Lina: ‘Do you become</p>
<p>a rose-tree, and I the rose upon it.’ When the three servants came to</p>
<p>the forest, nothing was there but a rose-tree and one rose on it, but</p>
<p>the children were nowhere. Then said they: ‘There is nothing to be done</p>
<p>here,’ and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing</p>
<p>in the forest but a little rose-bush with one rose on it. Then the</p>
<p>old cook scolded and said: ‘You simpletons, you should have cut the</p>
<p>rose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and brought it home with</p>
<p>you; go, and do it at once.’ They had therefore to go out and look for</p>
<p>the second time. The children, however, saw them coming from a distance.</p>
<p>Then Lina said: ‘Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never leave</p>
<p>you.’ Fundevogel said: ‘Neither now; nor ever.’ Said Lina: ‘Then do you</p>
<p>become a church, and I’ll be the chandelier in it.’ So when the three</p>
<p>servants came, nothing was there but a church, with a chandelier in</p>
<p>it. They said therefore to each other: ‘What can we do here, let us go</p>
<p>home.’ When they got home, the cook asked if they had not found them;</p>
<p>so they said no, they had found nothing but a church, and there was a</p>
<p>chandelier in it. And the cook scolded them and said: ‘You fools! why</p>
<p>did you not pull the church to pieces, and bring the chandelier home</p>
<p>with you?’ And now the old cook herself got on her legs, and went with</p>
<p>the three servants in pursuit of the children. The children, however,</p>
<p>saw from afar that the three servants were coming, and the cook waddling</p>
<p>after them. Then said Lina: ‘Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will</p>
<p>never leave you.’ Then said Fundevogel: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’</p>
<p>Said Lina: ‘Be a fishpond, and I will be the duck upon it.’ The cook,</p>
<p>however, came up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay down by it,</p>
<p>and was about to drink it up. But the duck swam quickly to her, seized</p>
<p>her head in its beak and drew her into the water, and there the old</p>
<p>witch had to drown. Then the children went home together, and were</p>
<p>heartily delighted, and if they have not died, they are living still.</p>
