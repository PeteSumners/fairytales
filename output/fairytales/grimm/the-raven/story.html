        <div class="story-content">
            <p>There was once a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run</p>
<p>alone. One day the child was very troublesome, and the mother could not</p>
<p>quiet it, do what she would. She grew impatient, and seeing the ravens</p>
<p>flying round the castle, she opened the window, and said: ‘I wish you</p>
<p>were a raven and would fly away, then I should have a little peace.’</p>
<p>Scarcely were the words out of her mouth, when the child in her arms was</p>
<p>turned into a raven, and flew away from her through the open window. The</p>
<p>bird took its flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long time,</p>
<p>and meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their child.</p>
<p>Long after this, a man was making his way through the wood when he heard</p>
<p>a raven calling, and he followed the sound of the voice. As he drew</p>
<p>near, the raven said, ‘I am by birth a king’s daughter, but am now under</p>
<p>the spell of some enchantment; you can, however, set me free.’ ‘What</p>
<p>am I to do?’ he asked. She replied, ‘Go farther into the wood until you</p>
<p>come to a house, wherein lives an old woman; she will offer you food and</p>
<p>drink, but you must not take of either; if you do, you will fall into</p>
<p>a deep sleep, and will not be able to help me. In the garden behind the</p>
<p>house is a large tan-heap, and on that you must stand and watch for me.</p>
<p>I shall drive there in my carriage at two o’clock in the afternoon for</p>
<p>three successive days; the first day it will be drawn by four white, the</p>
<p>second by four chestnut, and the last by four black horses; but if you</p>
<p>fail to keep awake and I find you sleeping, I shall not be set free.’</p>
<p>The man promised to do all that she wished, but the raven said, ‘Alas! I</p>
<p>know even now that you will take something from the woman and be unable</p>
<p>to save me.’ The man assured her again that he would on no account touch</p>
<p>a thing to eat or drink.</p>
<p>When he came to the house and went inside, the old woman met him, and</p>
<p>said, ‘Poor man! how tired you are! Come in and rest and let me give you</p>
<p>something to eat and drink.’</p>
<p>‘No,’ answered the man, ‘I will neither eat not drink.’</p>
<p>But she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, ‘If you will</p>
<p>not eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink</p>
<p>counts for nothing,’ and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded, and</p>
<p>drank.</p>
<p>As it drew towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the garden</p>
<p>and mounted the tan-heap to await the raven. Suddenly a feeling of</p>
<p>fatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little</p>
<p>while, fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in another minute</p>
<p>his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a deep sleep,</p>
<p>that all the noises in the world would not have awakened him. At two</p>
<p>o’clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses;</p>
<p>but even before she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing, ‘I</p>
<p>know he has fallen asleep.’ When she entered the garden, there she found</p>
<p>him as she had feared, lying on the tan-heap, fast asleep. She got out</p>
<p>of her carriage and went to him; she called him and shook him, but it</p>
<p>was all in vain, he still continued sleeping.</p>
<p>The next day at noon, the old woman came to him again with food and</p>
<p>drink which he at first refused. At last, overcome by her persistent</p>
<p>entreaties that he would take something, he lifted the glass and drank</p>
<p>again.</p>
<p>Towards two o’clock he went into the garden and on to the tan-heap to</p>
<p>watch for the raven. He had not been there long before he began to feel</p>
<p>so tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him, and he could</p>
<p>not stand upright any longer; so again he lay down and fell fast asleep.</p>
<p>As the raven drove along her four chestnut horses, she said sorrowfully</p>
<p>to herself, ‘I know he has fallen asleep.’ She went as before to look</p>
<p>for him, but he slept, and it was impossible to awaken him.</p>
<p>The following day the old woman said to him, ‘What is this? You are not</p>
<p>eating or drinking anything, do you want to kill yourself?’</p>
<p>He answered, ‘I may not and will not either eat or drink.’</p>
<p>But she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of him,</p>
<p>and when he smelt the wine, he was unable to resist the temptation, and</p>
<p>took a deep draught.</p>
<p>When the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tan-heap in</p>
<p>the garden to await the king’s daughter, but he felt even more overcome</p>
<p>with weariness than on the two previous days, and throwing himself down,</p>
<p>he slept like a log. At two o’clock the raven could be seen approaching,</p>
<p>and this time her coachman and everything about her, as well as her</p>
<p>horses, were black.</p>
<p>She was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, ‘I</p>
<p>know he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free.’ She</p>
<p>found him sleeping heavily, and all her efforts to awaken him were of no</p>
<p>avail. Then she placed beside him a loaf, and some meat, and a flask</p>
<p>of wine, of such a kind, that however much he took of them, they would</p>
<p>never grow less. After that she drew a gold ring, on which her name was</p>
<p>engraved, off her finger, and put it upon one of his. Finally, she laid</p>
<p>a letter near him, in which, after giving him particulars of the food</p>
<p>and drink she had left for him, she finished with the following words:</p>
<p>‘I see that as long as you remain here you will never be able to set me</p>
<p>free; if, however, you still wish to do so, come to the golden castle</p>
<p>of Stromberg; this is well within your power to accomplish.’ She then</p>
<p>returned to her carriage and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg.</p>
<p>When the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was grieved</p>
<p>at heart, and said, ‘She has no doubt been here and driven away again,</p>
<p>and it is now too late for me to save her.’ Then his eyes fell on the</p>
<p>things which were lying beside him; he read the letter, and knew from it</p>
<p>all that had happened. He rose up without delay, eager to start on his</p>
<p>way and to reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no idea in which</p>
<p>direction he ought to go. He travelled about a long time in search of it</p>
<p>and came at last to a dark forest, through which he went on walking for</p>
<p>fourteen days and still could not find a way out. Once more the night</p>
<p>came on, and worn out he lay down under a bush and fell asleep. Again</p>
<p>the next day he pursued his way through the forest, and that evening,</p>
<p>thinking to rest again, he lay down as before, but he heard such a</p>
<p>howling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep. He waited till</p>
<p>it was darker and people had begun to light up their houses, and then</p>
<p>seeing a little glimmer ahead of him, he went towards it.</p>
<p>He found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than</p>
<p>it really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense</p>
<p>giant who stood in front of it. He thought to himself, ‘If the giant</p>
<p>sees me going in, my life will not be worth much.’ However, after a</p>
<p>while he summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw him,</p>
<p>he called out, ‘It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had</p>
<p>anything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper.’ ‘I</p>
<p>would rather you let that alone,’ said the man, ‘for I do not willingly</p>
<p>give myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to</p>
<p>satisfy your hunger.’ ‘If that is so,’ replied the giant, ‘I will leave</p>
<p>you in peace; I only thought of eating you because I had nothing else.’</p>
<p>So they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought out the</p>
<p>bread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of them,</p>
<p>were still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and</p>
<p>ate and drank to his heart’s content. When he had finished his supper</p>
<p>the man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg.</p>
<p>The giant said, ‘I will look on my map; on it are marked all the towns,</p>
<p>villages, and houses.’ So he fetched his map, and looked for the castle,</p>
<p>but could not find it. ‘Never mind,’ he said, ‘I have larger maps</p>
<p>upstairs in the cupboard, we will look on those,’ but they searched in</p>
<p>vain, for the castle was not marked even on these. The man now thought</p>
<p>he should like to continue his journey, but the giant begged him to</p>
<p>remain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother, who was</p>
<p>away in search of provisions. When the brother came home, they asked him</p>
<p>about the castle of Stromberg, and he told them he would look on his own</p>
<p>maps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger. Accordingly, when</p>
<p>he had finished his supper, they all went up together to his room and</p>
<p>looked through his maps, but the castle was not to be found. Then he</p>
<p>fetched other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until</p>
<p>at last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away. ‘How shall I</p>
<p>be able to get there?’ asked the man. ‘I have two hours to spare,’ said</p>
<p>the giant, ‘and I will carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle; I</p>
<p>must then return to look after the child who is in our care.’</p>
<p>The giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred leagues</p>
<p>of the castle, where he left him, saying, ‘You will be able to walk the</p>
<p>remainder of the way yourself.’ The man journeyed on day and night</p>
<p>till he reached the golden castle of Stromberg. He found it situated,</p>
<p>however, on a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot he saw the</p>
<p>enchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside. He was</p>
<p>overjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but</p>
<p>the sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he</p>
<p>fell back again. When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was</p>
<p>greatly grieved, and said to himself, ‘I will remain here and wait for</p>
<p>her,’ so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for</p>
<p>a whole year, and every day he saw the king’s daughter driving round her</p>
<p>castle, but still was unable to get nearer to her.</p>
<p>Looking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he</p>
<p>called out to them, ‘God be with you.’ They stopped when they heard the</p>
<p>call, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their</p>
<p>fighting, which now became more furious. ‘God be with you,’ he cried</p>
<p>again, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went</p>
<p>back to their fighting. A third time he called out, ‘God be with you,’</p>
<p>and then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between</p>
<p>the three men, he went out and asked them why they were fighting so</p>
<p>angrily with one another. One of them said that he had found a stick,</p>
<p>and that he had but to strike it against any door through which he</p>
<p>wished to pass, and it immediately flew open. Another told him that he</p>
<p>had found a cloak which rendered its wearer invisible; and the third had</p>
<p>caught a horse which would carry its rider over any obstacle, and even</p>
<p>up the glass mountain. They had been unable to decide whether they</p>
<p>would keep together and have the things in common, or whether they would</p>
<p>separate. On hearing this, the man said, ‘I will give you something in</p>
<p>exchange for those three things; not money, for that I have not got,</p>
<p>but something that is of far more value. I must first, however, prove</p>
<p>whether all you have told me about your three things is true.’ The</p>
<p>robbers, therefore, made him get on the horse, and handed him the stick</p>
<p>and the cloak, and when he had put this round him he was no longer</p>
<p>visible. Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one after</p>
<p>another, crying, ‘There, you idle vagabonds, you have got what you</p>
<p>deserve; are you satisfied now!’</p>
<p>After this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the gate of</p>
<p>the castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his stick,</p>
<p>and it flew wide open at once and he passed through. He mounted the</p>
<p>steps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting, with a golden</p>
<p>goblet full of wine in front of her. She could not see him for he still</p>
<p>wore his cloak. He took the ring which she had given him off his finger,</p>
<p>and threw it into the goblet, so that it rang as it touched the bottom.</p>
<p>‘That is my own ring,’ she exclaimed, ‘and if that is so the man must</p>
<p>also be here who is coming to set me free.’</p>
<p>She sought for him about the castle, but could find him nowhere.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown off</p>
<p>the cloak. When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him, and</p>
<p>cried aloud for joy. Then he dismounted and took her in his arms; and</p>
<p>she kissed him, and said, ‘Now you have indeed set me free, and tomorrow</p>
<p>we will celebrate our marriage.’</p>
