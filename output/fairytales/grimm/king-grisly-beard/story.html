        <div class="story-content">
            <p>A great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very</p>
<p>beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the</p>
<p>princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she</p>
<p>only made sport of them.</p>
<p>Once upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all</p>
<p>her suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their</p>
<p>rank--kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons,</p>
<p>and knights. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she</p>
<p>had something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: ‘He’s</p>
<p>as round as a tub,’ said she. The next was too tall: ‘What a maypole!’</p>
<p>said she. The next was too short: ‘What a dumpling!’ said she. The</p>
<p>fourth was too pale, and she called him ‘Wallface.’ The fifth was too</p>
<p>red, so she called him ‘Coxcomb.’ The sixth was not straight enough;</p>
<p>so she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over</p>
<p>a baker’s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but</p>
<p>she laughed more than all at a good king who was there. ‘Look at</p>
<p>him,’ said she; ‘his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called</p>
<p>Grisly-beard.’ So the king got the nickname of Grisly-beard.</p>
<p>But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved,</p>
<p>and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or</p>
<p>unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that</p>
<p>came to the door.</p>
<p>Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play</p>
<p>under the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said,</p>
<p>‘Let him come in.’ So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when</p>
<p>he had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the</p>
<p>king said, ‘You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for</p>
<p>your wife.’ The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, ‘I have</p>
<p>sworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.’ So words</p>
<p>and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married</p>
<p>to the fiddler. When this was over the king said, ‘Now get ready to</p>
<p>go--you must not stay here--you must travel on with your husband.’</p>
<p>Then the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came</p>
<p>to a great wood. ‘Pray,’ said she, ‘whose is this wood?’ ‘It belongs</p>
<p>to King Grisly-beard,’ answered he; ‘hadst thou taken him, all had been</p>
<p>thine.’ ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘would that I had</p>
<p>married King Grisly-beard!’ Next they came to some fine meadows. ‘Whose</p>
<p>are these beautiful green meadows?’ said she. ‘They belong to King</p>
<p>Grisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.’ ‘Ah!</p>
<p>unlucky wretch that I am!’ said she; ‘would that I had married King</p>
<p>Grisly-beard!’</p>
<p>Then they came to a great city. ‘Whose is this noble city?’ said she.</p>
<p>‘It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been</p>
<p>thine.’ ‘Ah! wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘why did I not marry King</p>
<p>Grisly-beard?’ ‘That is no business of mine,’ said the fiddler: ‘why</p>
<p>should you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough for you?’</p>
<p>At last they came to a small cottage. ‘What a paltry place!’ said she;</p>
<p>‘to whom does that little dirty hole belong?’ Then the fiddler said,</p>
<p>‘That is your and my house, where we are to live.’ ‘Where are your</p>
<p>servants?’ cried she. ‘What do we want with servants?’ said he; ‘you</p>
<p>must do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put</p>
<p>on water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.’ But the princess knew</p>
<p>nothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help</p>
<p>her. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the</p>
<p>fiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus</p>
<p>they lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the</p>
<p>cottage, the man said, ‘Wife, we can’t go on thus, spending money and</p>
<p>earning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.’ Then he went out and</p>
<p>cut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made</p>
<p>her fingers very sore. ‘I see this work won’t do,’ said he: ‘try and</p>
<p>spin; perhaps you will do that better.’ So she sat down and tried to</p>
<p>spin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. ‘See</p>
<p>now,’ said the fiddler, ‘you are good for nothing; you can do no work:</p>
<p>what a bargain I have got! However, I’ll try and set up a trade in pots</p>
<p>and pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.’ ‘Alas!’</p>
<p>sighed she, ‘if any of my father’s court should pass by and see me</p>
<p>standing in the market, how they will laugh at me!’</p>
<p>But her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she</p>
<p>did not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many</p>
<p>people, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid</p>
<p>their money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on</p>
<p>this as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of</p>
<p>ware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but</p>
<p>a drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall,</p>
<p>and broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry,</p>
<p>and knew not what to do. ‘Ah! what will become of me?’ said she; ‘what</p>
<p>will my husband say?’ So she ran home and told him all. ‘Who would</p>
<p>have thought you would have been so silly,’ said he, ‘as to put an</p>
<p>earthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes?</p>
<p>but let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this sort of</p>
<p>work, so I have been to the king’s palace, and asked if they did not</p>
<p>want a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will</p>
<p>have plenty to eat.’</p>
<p>Thus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all</p>
<p>the dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat</p>
<p>that was left, and on this they lived.</p>
<p>She had not been there long before she heard that the king’s eldest son</p>
<p>was passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows</p>
<p>and looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of</p>
<p>the court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly</p>
<p>which had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich</p>
<p>meats, which she put into her basket to take home.</p>
<p>All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king’s son in golden</p>
<p>clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her</p>
<p>by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she</p>
<p>trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was</p>
<p>making sport of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the</p>
<p>cover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then</p>
<p>everybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she</p>
<p>wished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the</p>
<p>door to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and</p>
<p>brought her back and said, ‘Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived</p>
<p>with you in the hut. I brought you there because I really loved you. I</p>
<p>am also the soldier that overset your stall. I have done all this only</p>
<p>to cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your</p>
<p>ill-treatment of me. Now all is over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is</p>
<p>time to hold our marriage feast.’</p>
<p>Then the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and</p>
<p>her father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home</p>
<p>on her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was</p>
<p>grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you</p>
<p>and I had been of the party.</p>
