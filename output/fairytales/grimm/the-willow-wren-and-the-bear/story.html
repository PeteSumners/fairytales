        <div class="story-content">
            <p>Once in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest,</p>
<p>and the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said: ‘Brother</p>
<p>wolf, what bird is it that sings so well?’ ‘That is the King of birds,’</p>
<p>said the wolf, ‘before whom we must bow down.’ In reality the bird was</p>
<p>the willow-wren. ‘IF that’s the case,’ said the bear, ‘I should very</p>
<p>much like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.’ ‘That is not</p>
<p>done quite as you seem to think,’ said the wolf; ‘you must wait until</p>
<p>the Queen comes,’ Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in</p>
<p>her beak, and the lord King came too, and they began to feed their young</p>
<p>ones. The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him</p>
<p>back by the sleeve, and said: ‘No, you must wait until the lord and lady</p>
<p>Queen have gone away again.’ So they took stock of the hole where the</p>
<p>nest lay, and trotted away. The bear, however, could not rest until he</p>
<p>had seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it</p>
<p>again. The King and Queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw</p>
<p>five or six young ones lying there. ‘Is that the royal palace?’ cried</p>
<p>the bear; ‘it is a wretched palace, and you are not King’s children, you</p>
<p>are disreputable children!’ When the young wrens heard that, they were</p>
<p>frightfully angry, and screamed: ‘No, that we are not! Our parents are</p>
<p>honest people! Bear, you will have to pay for that!’</p>
<p>The bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their</p>
<p>holes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and</p>
<p>when their parents again brought food they said: ‘We will not so much as</p>
<p>touch one fly’s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have</p>
<p>settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been</p>
<p>here and has insulted us!’ Then the old King said: ‘Be easy, he shall</p>
<p>be punished,’ and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear’s cave, and</p>
<p>called in: ‘Old Growler, why have you insulted my children? You shall</p>
<p>suffer for it--we will punish you by a bloody war.’ Thus war was</p>
<p>announced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take</p>
<p>part in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth</p>
<p>contained. And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the</p>
<p>air, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and</p>
<p>flies had to come.</p>
<p>When the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies</p>
<p>to discover who was the enemy’s commander-in-chief. The gnat, who was</p>
<p>the most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled,</p>
<p>and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be</p>
<p>announced. There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him</p>
<p>and said: ‘Fox, you are the most cunning of all animals, you shall be</p>
<p>general and lead us.’ ‘Good,’ said the fox, ‘but what signal shall we</p>
<p>agree upon?’ No one knew that, so the fox said: ‘I have a fine long</p>
<p>bushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers. When I lift</p>
<p>my tail up quite high, all is going well, and you must charge; but if I</p>
<p>let it hang down, run away as fast as you can.’ When the gnat had heard</p>
<p>that, she flew away again, and revealed everything, down to the minutest</p>
<p>detail, to the willow-wren. When day broke, and the battle was to begin,</p>
<p>all the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the</p>
<p>earth trembled. The willow-wren with his army also came flying through</p>
<p>the air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one</p>
<p>was uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each</p>
<p>other. But the willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to settle</p>
<p>beneath the fox’s tail, and sting with all his might. When the fox felt</p>
<p>the first string, he started so that he lifted one leg, from pain, but</p>
<p>he bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second</p>
<p>sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could</p>
<p>hold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs. When</p>
<p>the animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began to flee, each</p>
<p>into his hole, and the birds had won the battle.</p>
<p>Then the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried:</p>
<p>‘Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart’s content, we have won</p>
<p>the battle!’ But the young wrens said: ‘We will not eat yet, the bear</p>
<p>must come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are honourable</p>
<p>children, before we will do that.’ Then the willow-wren flew to the</p>
<p>bear’s hole and cried: ‘Growler, you are to come to the nest to my</p>
<p>children, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your body shall</p>
<p>be broken.’ So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged</p>
<p>their pardon. And now at last the young wrens were satisfied, and sat</p>
<p>down together and ate and drank, and made merry till quite late into the</p>
<p>night.</p>
