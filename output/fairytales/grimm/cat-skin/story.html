        <div class="story-content">
            <p>There was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and was</p>
<p>so beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of</p>
<p>the earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her</p>
<p>end drew near she called the king to her and said, ‘Promise me that you</p>
<p>will never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful</p>
<p>as I am, and who has golden hair like mine.’ Then when the king in his</p>
<p>grief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died. But the king</p>
<p>was not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking</p>
<p>another wife. At last, however, his wise men said, ‘this will not do;</p>
<p>the king must marry again, that we may have a queen.’ So messengers were</p>
<p>sent far and wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen.</p>
<p>But there was no princess in the world so beautiful; and if there had</p>
<p>been, still there was not one to be found who had golden hair. So the</p>
<p>messengers came home, and had had all their trouble for nothing.</p>
<p>Now the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother,</p>
<p>and had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up, the king looked</p>
<p>at her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to</p>
<p>his courtiers, ‘May I not marry my daughter? She is the very image of my</p>
<p>dead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole</p>
<p>earth, and you say there must be a queen.’ When the courtiers heard this</p>
<p>they were shocked, and said, ‘Heaven forbid that a father should marry</p>
<p>his daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can come.’ And his daughter</p>
<p>was also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts;</p>
<p>so she said to him, ‘Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses:</p>
<p>one must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver,</p>
<p>like the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this,</p>
<p>I want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to</p>
<p>which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin.’ And thus</p>
<p>she thought he would think of the matter no more. But the king made the</p>
<p>most skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden,</p>
<p>like the sun; another silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling,</p>
<p>like the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in</p>
<p>his kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a</p>
<p>mantle of a thousand furs was made.</p>
<p>When all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the</p>
<p>night when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden</p>
<p>ring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three</p>
<p>dresses--of the sun, the moon, and the stars--up in a nutshell, and</p>
<p>wrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared</p>
<p>her face and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon Heaven for</p>
<p>help in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till</p>
<p>at last she came to a large wood. As she was very tired, she sat herself</p>
<p>down in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and there she slept</p>
<p>on till it was midday.</p>
<p>Now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs</p>
<p>came to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and</p>
<p>bark. ‘Look sharp!’ said the king to the huntsmen, ‘and see what sort</p>
<p>of game lies there.’ And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they</p>
<p>came back again said, ‘In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful</p>
<p>beast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand</p>
<p>kinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep.’ ‘See,’ said the king, ‘if</p>
<p>you can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.’ So the huntsmen</p>
<p>took it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said,</p>
<p>‘I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left; have pity on</p>
<p>me and take me with you.’ Then they said, ‘Yes, Miss Cat-skin, you will</p>
<p>do for the kitchen; you can sweep up the ashes, and do things of that</p>
<p>sort.’ So they put her into the coach, and took her home to the king’s</p>
<p>palace. Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase, where</p>
<p>no light of day ever peeped in, and said, ‘Cat-skin, you may lie and</p>
<p>sleep there.’ And she was sent into the kitchen, and made to fetch wood</p>
<p>and water, to blow the fire, pluck the poultry, pick the herbs, sift the</p>
<p>ashes, and do all the dirty work.</p>
<p>Thus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. ‘Ah! pretty</p>
<p>princess!’ thought she, ‘what will now become of thee?’ But it happened</p>
<p>one day that a feast was to be held in the king’s castle, so she said to</p>
<p>the cook, ‘May I go up a little while and see what is going on? I will</p>
<p>take care and stand behind the door.’ And the cook said, ‘Yes, you may</p>
<p>go, but be back again in half an hour’s time, to rake out the ashes.’</p>
<p>Then she took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the</p>
<p>fur skin, and washed the soot from off her face and hands, so that her</p>
<p>beauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened</p>
<p>her nutshell, and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun,</p>
<p>and so went to the feast. Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew</p>
<p>her, and they thought she could be no less than a king’s daughter. But</p>
<p>the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and</p>
<p>he thought in his heart, ‘I never saw any one half so beautiful.’</p>
<p>When the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked</p>
<p>round for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood</p>
<p>at the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth</p>
<p>was, that she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress,</p>
<p>blackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was</p>
<p>Cat-skin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began</p>
<p>to rake the ashes, the cook said, ‘Let that alone till the morning, and</p>
<p>heat the king’s soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but</p>
<p>take care you don’t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of</p>
<p>never eating again.’</p>
<p>As soon as the cook went away, Cat-skin heated the king’s soup, and</p>
<p>toasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when it</p>
<p>was ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ring,</p>
<p>and put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was over,</p>
<p>the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well,</p>
<p>that he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom</p>
<p>he saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got</p>
<p>there, he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened when</p>
<p>he heard the order, and said to Cat-skin, ‘You must have let a hair fall</p>
<p>into the soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating.’ Then he went</p>
<p>before the king, and he asked him who had cooked the soup. ‘I did,’</p>
<p>answered the cook. But the king said, ‘That is not true; it was better</p>
<p>done than you could do it.’ Then he answered, ‘To tell the truth I did</p>
<p>not cook it, but Cat-skin did.’ ‘Then let Cat-skin come up,’ said the</p>
<p>king: and when she came he said to her, ‘Who are you?’ ‘I am a poor</p>
<p>child,’ said she, ‘that has lost both father and mother.’ ‘How came you</p>
<p>in my palace?’ asked he. ‘I am good for nothing,’ said she, ‘but to be</p>
<p>scullion-girl, and to have boots and shoes thrown at my head.’ ‘But how</p>
<p>did you get the ring that was in the soup?’ asked the king. Then she</p>
<p>would not own that she knew anything about the ring; so the king sent</p>
<p>her away again about her business.</p>
<p>After a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook to let</p>
<p>her go up and see it as before. ‘Yes,’ said he, ‘but come again in half</p>
<p>an hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.’ Then she</p>
<p>ran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress</p>
<p>out which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in,</p>
<p>looking like a king’s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at</p>
<p>seeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her. After the</p>
<p>dance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the king did</p>
<p>not see where she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin, and</p>
<p>made herself into Cat-skin again, and went into the kitchen to cook the</p>
<p>soup. Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got the golden necklace and</p>
<p>dropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king, who ate it,</p>
<p>and it pleased him as well as before; so he sent for the cook, who</p>
<p>was again forced to tell him that Cat-skin had cooked it. Cat-skin was</p>
<p>brought again before the king, but she still told him that she was only</p>
<p>fit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head.</p>
<p>But when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third</p>
<p>time, it happened just the same as before. ‘You must be a witch,</p>
<p>Cat-skin,’ said the cook; ‘for you always put something into your soup,</p>
<p>so that it pleases the king better than mine.’ However, he let her go up</p>
<p>as before. Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and</p>
<p>went into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and</p>
<p>thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then. So whilst</p>
<p>he was dancing with her, he put a gold ring on her finger without her</p>
<p>seeing it, and ordered that the dance should be kept up a long time.</p>
<p>When it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the hand, but she</p>
<p>slipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sight</p>
<p>of her: and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin under</p>
<p>the stairs. But this time she kept away too long, and stayed beyond the</p>
<p>half-hour; so she had not time to take off her fine dress, and threw her</p>
<p>fur mantle over it, and in her haste did not blacken herself all over</p>
<p>with soot, but left one of her fingers white.</p>
<p>Then she ran into the kitchen, and cooked the king’s soup; and as soon</p>
<p>as the cook was gone, she put the golden brooch into the dish. When the</p>
<p>king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and</p>
<p>soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst</p>
<p>they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and</p>
<p>when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off</p>
<p>a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.</p>
<p>Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and</p>
<p>beautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she</p>
<p>washed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the</p>
<p>most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said,</p>
<p>‘You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each</p>
<p>other.’ And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever</p>
<p>was heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.</p>
