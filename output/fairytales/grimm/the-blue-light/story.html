        <div class="story-content">
            <p>There was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the</p>
<p>king faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer</p>
<p>because of the many wounds which he had received. The king said to him:</p>
<p>‘You may return to your home, I need you no longer, and you will not</p>
<p>receive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me</p>
<p>service for them.’ Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living,</p>
<p>went away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the</p>
<p>evening he entered a forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light,</p>
<p>which he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. ‘Do give</p>
<p>me one night’s lodging, and a little to eat and drink,’ said he to</p>
<p>her, ‘or I shall starve.’ ‘Oho!’ she answered, ‘who gives anything to a</p>
<p>run-away soldier? Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you</p>
<p>will do what I wish.’ ‘What do you wish?’ said the soldier. ‘That you</p>
<p>should dig all round my garden for me, tomorrow.’ The soldier consented,</p>
<p>and next day laboured with all his strength, but could not finish it by</p>
<p>the evening. ‘I see well enough,’ said the witch, ‘that you can do no</p>
<p>more today, but I will keep you yet another night, in payment for</p>
<p>which you must tomorrow chop me a load of wood, and chop it small.’ The</p>
<p>soldier spent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the witch</p>
<p>proposed that he should stay one night more. ‘Tomorrow, you shall only</p>
<p>do me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my house, there is an old</p>
<p>dry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns blue, and never goes</p>
<p>out, and you shall bring it up again.’ Next day the old woman took him</p>
<p>to the well, and let him down in a basket. He found the blue light, and</p>
<p>made her a signal to draw him up again. She did draw him up, but when he</p>
<p>came near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the</p>
<p>blue light away from him. ‘No,’ said he, perceiving her evil intention,</p>
<p>‘I will not give you the light until I am standing with both feet upon</p>
<p>the ground.’ The witch fell into a passion, let him fall again into the</p>
<p>well, and went away.</p>
<p>The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue</p>
<p>light went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw very well</p>
<p>that he could not escape death. He sat for a while very sorrowfully,</p>
<p>then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which</p>
<p>was still half full. ‘This shall be my last pleasure,’ thought he,</p>
<p>pulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to smoke. When the</p>
<p>smoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood</p>
<p>before him, and said: ‘Lord, what are your commands?’ ‘What my commands</p>
<p>are?’ replied the soldier, quite astonished. ‘I must do everything you</p>
<p>bid me,’ said the little man. ‘Good,’ said the soldier; ‘then in the</p>
<p>first place help me out of this well.’ The little man took him by the</p>
<p>hand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget</p>
<p>to take the blue light with him. On the way the dwarf showed him the</p>
<p>treasures which the witch had collected and hidden there, and the</p>
<p>soldier took as much gold as he could carry. When he was above, he said</p>
<p>to the little man: ‘Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before</p>
<p>the judge.’ In a short time she came by like the wind, riding on a wild</p>
<p>tom-cat and screaming frightfully. Nor was it long before the little man</p>
<p>reappeared. ‘It is all done,’ said he, ‘and the witch is already hanging</p>
<p>on the gallows. What further commands has my lord?’ inquired the dwarf.</p>
<p>‘At this moment, none,’ answered the soldier; ‘you can return home, only</p>
<p>be at hand immediately, if I summon you.’ ‘Nothing more is needed than</p>
<p>that you should light your pipe at the blue light, and I will appear</p>
<p>before you at once.’ Thereupon he vanished from his sight.</p>
<p>The soldier returned to the town from which he came. He went to the</p>
<p>best inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord</p>
<p>furnish him a room as handsome as possible. When it was ready and the</p>
<p>soldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin</p>
<p>and said: ‘I have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me,</p>
<p>and left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.’ ‘What am I to</p>
<p>do?’ asked the little man. ‘Late at night, when the king’s daughter is</p>
<p>in bed, bring her here in her sleep, she shall do servant’s work for</p>
<p>me.’ The manikin said: ‘That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very</p>
<p>dangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.’</p>
<p>When twelve o’clock had struck, the door sprang open, and the manikin</p>
<p>carried in the princess. ‘Aha! are you there?’ cried the soldier, ‘get</p>
<p>to your work at once! Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.’ When</p>
<p>she had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he</p>
<p>stretched out his feet and said: ‘Pull off my boots,’ and then he</p>
<p>threw them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean</p>
<p>and brighten them. She, however, did everything he bade her, without</p>
<p>opposition, silently and with half-shut eyes. When the first cock</p>
<p>crowed, the manikin carried her back to the royal palace, and laid her</p>
<p>in her bed.</p>
<p>Next morning when the princess arose she went to her father, and told</p>
<p>him that she had had a very strange dream. ‘I was carried through the</p>
<p>streets with the rapidity of lightning,’ said she, ‘and taken into a</p>
<p>soldier’s room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his</p>
<p>room, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a</p>
<p>dream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.’</p>
<p>‘The dream may have been true,’ said the king. ‘I will give you a piece</p>
<p>of advice. Fill your pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in the</p>
<p>pocket, and then if you are carried away again, they will fall out and</p>
<p>leave a track in the streets.’ But unseen by the king, the manikin was</p>
<p>standing beside him when he said that, and heard all. At night when</p>
<p>the sleeping princess was again carried through the streets, some peas</p>
<p>certainly did fall out of her pocket, but they made no track, for the</p>
<p>crafty manikin had just before scattered peas in every street there</p>
<p>was. And again the princess was compelled to do servant’s work until</p>
<p>cock-crow.</p>
<p>Next morning the king sent his people out to seek the track, but it was</p>
<p>all in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up</p>
<p>peas, and saying: ‘It must have rained peas, last night.’ ‘We must think</p>
<p>of something else,’ said the king; ‘keep your shoes on when you go to</p>
<p>bed, and before you come back from the place where you are taken, hide</p>
<p>one of them there, I will soon contrive to find it.’ The black manikin</p>
<p>heard this plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to</p>
<p>bring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no</p>
<p>expedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found</p>
<p>in the soldier’s house it would go badly with him. ‘Do what I bid you,’</p>
<p>replied the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged</p>
<p>to work like a servant, but before she went away, she hid her shoe under</p>
<p>the bed.</p>
<p>Next morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughter’s</p>
<p>shoe. It was found at the soldier’s, and the soldier himself, who at the</p>
<p>entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back,</p>
<p>and thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable</p>
<p>things he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in</p>
<p>his pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of</p>
<p>his dungeon, when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. The</p>
<p>soldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up, said to</p>
<p>him: ‘Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in</p>
<p>the inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.’ His comrade ran</p>
<p>thither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone</p>
<p>again, he lighted his pipe and summoned the black manikin. ‘Have no</p>
<p>fear,’ said the latter to his master. ‘Go wheresoever they take you, and</p>
<p>let them do what they will, only take the blue light with you.’ Next day</p>
<p>the soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge</p>
<p>condemned him to death. When he was led forth to die, he begged a last</p>
<p>favour of the king. ‘What is it?’ asked the king. ‘That I may smoke one</p>
<p>more pipe on my way.’ ‘You may smoke three,’ answered the king, ‘but do</p>
<p>not imagine that I will spare your life.’ Then the soldier pulled out</p>
<p>his pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths</p>
<p>of smoke had ascended, the manikin was there with a small cudgel in his</p>
<p>hand, and said: ‘What does my lord command?’ ‘Strike down to earth that</p>
<p>false judge there, and his constable, and spare not the king who has</p>
<p>treated me so ill.’ Then the manikin fell on them like lightning,</p>
<p>darting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by</p>
<p>his cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again. The king</p>
<p>was terrified; he threw himself on the soldier’s mercy, and merely to</p>
<p>be allowed to live at all, gave him his kingdom for his own, and his</p>
<p>daughter to wife.</p>
