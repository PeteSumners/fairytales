        <div class="story-content">
            <p>There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and</p>
<p>loved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she</p>
<p>wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all</p>
<p>seven to her and said: ‘Dear children, I have to go into the forest,</p>
<p>be on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you</p>
<p>all--skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often disguises himself, but</p>
<p>you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.’ The</p>
<p>kids said: ‘Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go</p>
<p>away without any anxiety.’ Then the old one bleated, and went on her way</p>
<p>with an easy mind.</p>
<p>It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called:</p>
<p>‘Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought</p>
<p>something back with her for each of you.’ But the little kids knew that</p>
<p>it was the wolf, by the rough voice. ‘We will not open the door,’ cried</p>
<p>they, ‘you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but</p>
<p>your voice is rough; you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf went away to a</p>
<p>shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made</p>
<p>his voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the</p>
<p>house, and called: ‘Open the door, dear children, your mother is here</p>
<p>and has brought something back with her for each of you.’ But the wolf</p>
<p>had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them</p>
<p>and cried: ‘We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet</p>
<p>like you: you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf ran to a baker and said: ‘I</p>
<p>have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.’ And when the baker</p>
<p>had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said: ‘Strew some</p>
<p>white meal over my feet for me.’ The miller thought to himself: ‘The</p>
<p>wolf wants to deceive someone,’ and refused; but the wolf said: ‘If you</p>
<p>will not do it, I will devour you.’ Then the miller was afraid, and made</p>
<p>his paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of mankind.</p>
<p>So now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at</p>
<p>it and said: ‘Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother</p>
<p>has come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the</p>
<p>forest with her.’ The little kids cried: ‘First show us your paws that</p>
<p>we may know if you are our dear little mother.’ Then he put his paws</p>
<p>in through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they</p>
<p>believed that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should</p>
<p>come in but the wolf! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.</p>
<p>One sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the</p>
<p>stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the</p>
<p>sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But</p>
<p>the wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the</p>
<p>other he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest, who was in</p>
<p>the clock-case, was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had</p>
<p>satisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a</p>
<p>tree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep. Soon afterwards</p>
<p>the old goat came home again from the forest. Ah! what a sight she saw</p>
<p>there! The house-door stood wide open. The table, chairs, and benches</p>
<p>were thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts</p>
<p>and pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her children, but they</p>
<p>were nowhere to be found. She called them one after another by name, but</p>
<p>no one answered. At last, when she came to the youngest, a soft voice</p>
<p>cried: ‘Dear mother, I am in the clock-case.’ She took the kid out, and</p>
<p>it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Then</p>
<p>you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.</p>
<p>At length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her.</p>
<p>When they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored</p>
<p>so loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side and</p>
<p>saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly. ‘Ah,</p>
<p>heavens,’ she said, ‘is it possible that my poor children whom he has</p>
<p>swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?’ Then the kid had to</p>
<p>run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the goat cut</p>
<p>open the monster’s stomach, and hardly had she made one cut, than one</p>
<p>little kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six</p>
<p>sprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered</p>
<p>no injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them</p>
<p>down whole. What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother,</p>
<p>and jumped like a tailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said: ‘Now</p>
<p>go and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast’s</p>
<p>stomach with them while he is still asleep.’ Then the seven kids dragged</p>
<p>the stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into this</p>
<p>stomach as they could get in; and the mother sewed him up again in the</p>
<p>greatest haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once</p>
<p>stirred.</p>
<p>When the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs,</p>
<p>and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to</p>
<p>go to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about, the</p>
<p>stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried</p>
<p>he:</p>
<p>‘What rumbles and tumbles</p>
<p>Against my poor bones?</p>
<p>I thought ‘twas six kids,</p>
<p>But it feels like big stones.’</p>
<p>And when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the</p>
<p>heavy stones made him fall in, and he drowned miserably. When the seven</p>
<p>kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: ‘The wolf</p>
<p>is dead! The wolf is dead!’ and danced for joy round about the well with</p>
<p>their mother.</p>
