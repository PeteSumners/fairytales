        <div class="story-content">
            <p>One summer’s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the</p>
<p>window; he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might. Then came</p>
<p>a peasant woman down the street crying: ‘Good jams, cheap! Good jams,</p>
<p>cheap!’ This rang pleasantly in the tailor’s ears; he stretched his</p>
<p>delicate head out of the window, and called: ‘Come up here, dear woman;</p>
<p>here you will get rid of your goods.’ The woman came up the three steps</p>
<p>to the tailor with her heavy basket, and he made her unpack all the pots</p>
<p>for him. He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and</p>
<p>at length said: ‘The jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four</p>
<p>ounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no</p>
<p>consequence.’ The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him</p>
<p>what he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling. ‘Now, this jam</p>
<p>shall be blessed by God,’ cried the little tailor, ‘and give me health</p>
<p>and strength’; so he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself</p>
<p>a piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it. ‘This won’t</p>
<p>taste bitter,’ said he, ‘but I will just finish the jacket before I</p>
<p>take a bite.’ He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made</p>
<p>bigger and bigger stitches. In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam</p>
<p>rose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were</p>
<p>attracted and descended on it in hosts. ‘Hi! who invited you?’ said the</p>
<p>little tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away. The flies, however,</p>
<p>who understood no German, would not be turned away, but came back</p>
<p>again in ever-increasing companies. The little tailor at last lost all</p>
<p>patience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table,</p>
<p>and saying: ‘Wait, and I will give it to you,’ struck it mercilessly on</p>
<p>them. When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer</p>
<p>than seven, dead and with legs stretched out. ‘Are you a fellow of that</p>
<p>sort?’ said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery. ‘The whole</p>
<p>town shall know of this!’ And the little tailor hastened to cut himself</p>
<p>a girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters: ‘Seven at</p>
<p>one stroke!’ ‘What, the town!’ he continued, ‘the whole world shall hear</p>
<p>of it!’ and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb’s tail. The tailor</p>
<p>put on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he</p>
<p>thought his workshop was too small for his valour. Before he went away,</p>
<p>he sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could</p>
<p>take with him; however, he found nothing but an old cheese, and that</p>
<p>he put in his pocket. In front of the door he observed a bird which</p>
<p>had caught itself in the thicket. It had to go into his pocket with the</p>
<p>cheese. Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble,</p>
<p>he felt no fatigue. The road led him up a mountain, and when he had</p>
<p>reached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking</p>
<p>peacefully about him. The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to him,</p>
<p>and said: ‘Good day, comrade, so you are sitting there overlooking the</p>
<p>wide-spread world! I am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck.</p>
<p>Have you any inclination to go with me?’ The giant looked contemptuously</p>
<p>at the tailor, and said: ‘You ragamuffin! You miserable creature!’</p>
<p>‘Oh, indeed?’ answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and</p>
<p>showed the giant the girdle, ‘there may you read what kind of a man I</p>
<p>am!’ The giant read: ‘Seven at one stroke,’ and thought that they had</p>
<p>been men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect</p>
<p>for the tiny fellow. Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took</p>
<p>a stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out</p>
<p>of it. ‘Do that likewise,’ said the giant, ‘if you have strength.’ ‘Is</p>
<p>that all?’ said the tailor, ‘that is child’s play with us!’ and put his</p>
<p>hand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until</p>
<p>the liquid ran out of it. ‘Faith,’ said he, ‘that was a little better,</p>
<p>wasn’t it?’ The giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it</p>
<p>of the little man. Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high</p>
<p>that the eye could scarcely follow it. ‘Now, little mite of a man, do</p>
<p>that likewise,’ ‘Well thrown,’ said the tailor, ‘but after all the stone</p>
<p>came down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come</p>
<p>back at all,’ and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird,</p>
<p>and threw it into the air. The bird, delighted with its liberty,</p>
<p>rose, flew away and did not come back. ‘How does that shot please you,</p>
<p>comrade?’ asked the tailor. ‘You can certainly throw,’ said the giant,</p>
<p>‘but now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly.’ He</p>
<p>took the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on</p>
<p>the ground, and said: ‘If you are strong enough, help me to carry the</p>
<p>tree out of the forest.’ ‘Readily,’ answered the little man; ‘take you</p>
<p>the trunk on your shoulders, and I will raise up the branches and twigs;</p>
<p>after all, they are the heaviest.’ The giant took the trunk on his</p>
<p>shoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who</p>
<p>could not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little</p>
<p>tailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and</p>
<p>whistled the song: ‘Three tailors rode forth from the gate,’ as if</p>
<p>carrying the tree were child’s play. The giant, after he had dragged the</p>
<p>heavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried: ‘Hark</p>
<p>you, I shall have to let the tree fall!’ The tailor sprang nimbly down,</p>
<p>seized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and said</p>
<p>to the giant: ‘You are such a great fellow, and yet cannot even carry</p>
<p>the tree!’</p>
<p>They went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid</p>
<p>hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it</p>
<p>down, gave it into the tailor’s hand, and bade him eat. But the little</p>
<p>tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go,</p>
<p>it sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it.</p>
<p>When he had fallen down again without injury, the giant said: ‘What is</p>
<p>this? Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?’ ‘There is no</p>
<p>lack of strength,’ answered the little tailor. ‘Do you think that could</p>
<p>be anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow? I leapt over</p>
<p>the tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket.</p>
<p>Jump as I did, if you can do it.’ The giant made the attempt but he</p>
<p>could not get over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so</p>
<p>that in this also the tailor kept the upper hand.</p>
<p>The giant said: ‘If you are such a valiant fellow, come with me into our</p>
<p>cavern and spend the night with us.’ The little tailor was willing, and</p>
<p>followed him. When they went into the cave, other giants were sitting</p>
<p>there by the fire, and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand and</p>
<p>was eating it. The little tailor looked round and thought: ‘It is much</p>
<p>more spacious here than in my workshop.’ The giant showed him a bed, and</p>
<p>said he was to lie down in it and sleep. The bed, however, was too</p>
<p>big for the little tailor; he did not lie down in it, but crept into</p>
<p>a corner. When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the little</p>
<p>tailor was lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar,</p>
<p>cut through the bed with one blow, and thought he had finished off the</p>
<p>grasshopper for good. With the earliest dawn the giants went into the</p>
<p>forest, and had quite forgotten the little tailor, when all at once he</p>
<p>walked up to them quite merrily and boldly. The giants were terrified,</p>
<p>they were afraid that he would strike them all dead, and ran away in a</p>
<p>great hurry.</p>
<p>The little tailor went onwards, always following his own pointed nose.</p>
<p>After he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard of a royal</p>
<p>palace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and fell asleep.</p>
<p>Whilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all sides, and</p>
<p>read on his girdle: ‘Seven at one stroke.’ ‘Ah!’ said they, ‘what does</p>
<p>the great warrior want here in the midst of peace? He must be a mighty</p>
<p>lord.’ They went and announced him to the king, and gave it as their</p>
<p>opinion that if war should break out, this would be a weighty and useful</p>
<p>man who ought on no account to be allowed to depart. The counsel pleased</p>
<p>the king, and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer</p>
<p>him military service when he awoke. The ambassador remained standing by</p>
<p>the sleeper, waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes,</p>
<p>and then conveyed to him this proposal. ‘For this very reason have</p>
<p>I come here,’ the tailor replied, ‘I am ready to enter the king’s</p>
<p>service.’ He was therefore honourably received, and a special dwelling</p>
<p>was assigned him.</p>
<p>The soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and wished</p>
<p>him a thousand miles away. ‘What is to be the end of this?’ they said</p>
<p>among themselves. ‘If we quarrel with him, and he strikes about him,</p>
<p>seven of us will fall at every blow; not one of us can stand against</p>
<p>him.’ They came therefore to a decision, betook themselves in a body to</p>
<p>the king, and begged for their dismissal. ‘We are not prepared,’ said</p>
<p>they, ‘to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke.’ The king was</p>
<p>sorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants,</p>
<p>wished that he had never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly</p>
<p>have been rid of him again. But he did not venture to give him his</p>
<p>dismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people</p>
<p>dead, and place himself on the royal throne. He thought about it for a</p>
<p>long time, and at last found good counsel. He sent to the little tailor</p>
<p>and caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior, he had one</p>
<p>request to make to him. In a forest of his country lived two giants,</p>
<p>who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging,</p>
<p>and burning, and no one could approach them without putting himself in</p>
<p>danger of death. If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants, he</p>
<p>would give him his only daughter to wife, and half of his kingdom as a</p>
<p>dowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him.</p>
<p>‘That would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me!’ thought the</p>
<p>little tailor. ‘One is not offered a beautiful princess and half a</p>
<p>kingdom every day of one’s life!’ ‘Oh, yes,’ he replied, ‘I will soon</p>
<p>subdue the giants, and do not require the help of the hundred horsemen</p>
<p>to do it; he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of</p>
<p>two.’</p>
<p>The little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed him.</p>
<p>When he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his followers:</p>
<p>‘Just stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the giants.’ Then</p>
<p>he bounded into the forest and looked about right and left. After a</p>
<p>while he perceived both giants. They lay sleeping under a tree, and</p>
<p>snored so that the branches waved up and down. The little tailor, not</p>
<p>idle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the</p>
<p>tree. When he was halfway up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat</p>
<p>just above the sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on</p>
<p>the breast of one of the giants. For a long time the giant felt nothing,</p>
<p>but at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said: ‘Why are you</p>
<p>knocking me?’ ‘You must be dreaming,’ said the other, ‘I am not knocking</p>
<p>you.’ They laid themselves down to sleep again, and then the tailor</p>
<p>threw a stone down on the second. ‘What is the meaning of this?’ cried</p>
<p>the other ‘Why are you pelting me?’ ‘I am not pelting you,’ answered</p>
<p>the first, growling. They disputed about it for a time, but as they were</p>
<p>weary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed once more. The</p>
<p>little tailor began his game again, picked out the biggest stone, and</p>
<p>threw it with all his might on the breast of the first giant. ‘That</p>
<p>is too bad!’ cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his</p>
<p>companion against the tree until it shook. The other paid him back in</p>
<p>the same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and</p>
<p>belaboured each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on</p>
<p>the ground at the same time. Then the little tailor leapt down. ‘It is</p>
<p>a lucky thing,’ said he, ‘that they did not tear up the tree on which</p>
<p>I was sitting, or I should have had to sprint on to another like a</p>
<p>squirrel; but we tailors are nimble.’ He drew out his sword and gave</p>
<p>each of them a couple of thrusts in the breast, and then went out to the</p>
<p>horsemen and said: ‘The work is done; I have finished both of them</p>
<p>off, but it was hard work! They tore up trees in their sore need, and</p>
<p>defended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man</p>
<p>like myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.’ ‘But are you not</p>
<p>wounded?’ asked the horsemen. ‘You need not concern yourself about</p>
<p>that,’ answered the tailor, ‘they have not bent one hair of mine.’ The</p>
<p>horsemen would not believe him, and rode into the forest; there they</p>
<p>found the giants swimming in their blood, and all round about lay the</p>
<p>torn-up trees.</p>
<p>The little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; he, however,</p>
<p>repented of his promise, and again bethought himself how he could get</p>
<p>rid of the hero. ‘Before you receive my daughter, and the half of my</p>
<p>kingdom,’ said he to him, ‘you must perform one more heroic deed. In</p>
<p>the forest roams a unicorn which does great harm, and you must catch</p>
<p>it first.’ ‘I fear one unicorn still less than two giants. Seven at one</p>
<p>blow, is my kind of affair.’ He took a rope and an axe with him, went</p>
<p>forth into the forest, and again bade those who were sent with him to</p>
<p>wait outside. He had not long to seek. The unicorn soon came towards</p>
<p>him, and rushed directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its</p>
<p>horn without more ado. ‘Softly, softly; it can’t be done as quickly as</p>
<p>that,’ said he, and stood still and waited until the animal was quite</p>
<p>close, and then sprang nimbly behind the tree. The unicorn ran against</p>
<p>the tree with all its strength, and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk</p>
<p>that it had not the strength enough to draw it out again, and thus it</p>
<p>was caught. ‘Now, I have got the bird,’ said the tailor, and came out</p>
<p>from behind the tree and put the rope round its neck, and then with his</p>
<p>axe he hewed the horn out of the tree, and when all was ready he led the</p>
<p>beast away and took it to the king.</p>
<p>The king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third</p>
<p>demand. Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that</p>
<p>made great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give him their</p>
<p>help. ‘Willingly,’ said the tailor, ‘that is child’s play!’ He did not</p>
<p>take the huntsmen with him into the forest, and they were well pleased</p>
<p>that he did not, for the wild boar had several times received them in</p>
<p>such a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him. When</p>
<p>the boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and</p>
<p>whetted tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the hero</p>
<p>fled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at</p>
<p>once, and in one bound out again. The boar ran after him, but the tailor</p>
<p>ran round outside and shut the door behind it, and then the raging</p>
<p>beast, which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window,</p>
<p>was caught. The little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they</p>
<p>might see the prisoner with their own eyes. The hero, however, went to</p>
<p>the king, who was now, whether he liked it or not, obliged to keep his</p>
<p>promise, and gave his daughter and the half of his kingdom. Had he known</p>
<p>that it was no warlike hero, but a little tailor who was standing before</p>
<p>him, it would have gone to his heart still more than it did. The wedding</p>
<p>was held with great magnificence and small joy, and out of a tailor a</p>
<p>king was made.</p>
<p>After some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at</p>
<p>night: ‘Boy, make me the doublet, and patch the pantaloons, or else I</p>
<p>will rap the yard-measure over your ears.’ Then she discovered in what</p>
<p>state of life the young lord had been born, and next morning complained</p>
<p>of her wrongs to her father, and begged him to help her to get rid of</p>
<p>her husband, who was nothing else but a tailor. The king comforted her</p>
<p>and said: ‘Leave your bedroom door open this night, and my servants</p>
<p>shall stand outside, and when he has fallen asleep shall go in, bind</p>
<p>him, and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wide</p>
<p>world.’ The woman was satisfied with this; but the king’s armour-bearer,</p>
<p>who had heard all, was friendly with the young lord, and informed him of</p>
<p>the whole plot. ‘I’ll put a screw into that business,’ said the little</p>
<p>tailor. At night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time, and</p>
<p>when she thought that he had fallen asleep, she got up, opened the door,</p>
<p>and then lay down again. The little tailor, who was only pretending to</p>
<p>be asleep, began to cry out in a clear voice: ‘Boy, make me the doublet</p>
<p>and patch me the pantaloons, or I will rap the yard-measure over your</p>
<p>ears. I smote seven at one blow. I killed two giants, I brought away one</p>
<p>unicorn, and caught a wild boar, and am I to fear those who are standing</p>
<p>outside the room.’ When these men heard the tailor speaking thus, they</p>
<p>were overcome by a great dread, and ran as if the wild huntsman were</p>
<p>behind them, and none of them would venture anything further against</p>
<p>him. So the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of his</p>
<p>life.</p>
