        <div class="story-content">
            <p>The king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of their</p>
<p>only child. This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and her</p>
<p>mother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her. And there was a good</p>
<p>fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch</p>
<p>over her. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a</p>
<p>great way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she</p>
<p>got ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen her</p>
<p>mother, packed up a great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and</p>
<p>silver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short everything that became a</p>
<p>royal bride. And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give</p>
<p>her into the bridegroom’s hands; and each had a horse for the journey.</p>
<p>Now the princess’s horse was the fairy’s gift, and it was called Falada,</p>
<p>and could speak.</p>
<p>When the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her</p>
<p>bed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair,</p>
<p>and gave it to the princess, and said, ‘Take care of it, dear child; for</p>
<p>it is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.’ Then they all took</p>
<p>a sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into</p>
<p>her bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her</p>
<p>bridegroom’s kingdom.</p>
<p>One day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to</p>
<p>feel very thirsty: and she said to her maid, ‘Pray get down, and fetch</p>
<p>me some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to</p>
<p>drink.’ ‘Nay,’ said the maid, ‘if you are thirsty, get off yourself, and</p>
<p>stoop down by the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any</p>
<p>longer.’ Then she was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the</p>
<p>little brook, and drank; for she was frightened, and dared not bring out</p>
<p>her golden cup; and she wept and said, ‘Alas! what will become of me?’</p>
<p>And the lock answered her, and said:</p>
<p>‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,</p>
<p>Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’</p>
<p>But the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her</p>
<p>maid’s ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again.</p>
<p>Then all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and</p>
<p>the sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again;</p>
<p>and at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid’s rude</p>
<p>speech, and said, ‘Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in</p>
<p>my golden cup.’ But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily</p>
<p>than before: ‘Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.’</p>
<p>Then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay</p>
<p>down, and held her head over the running stream, and cried and said,</p>
<p>‘What will become of me?’ And the lock of hair answered her again:</p>
<p>‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,</p>
<p>Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’</p>
<p>And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom,</p>
<p>and floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did</p>
<p>not see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the</p>
<p>charm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that</p>
<p>she had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and would</p>
<p>have got upon Falada again, the maid said, ‘I shall ride upon Falada,</p>
<p>and you may have my horse instead’; so she was forced to give up her</p>
<p>horse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her</p>
<p>maid’s shabby ones.</p>
<p>At last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous</p>
<p>servant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had</p>
<p>happened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well.</p>
<p>Then the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon the</p>
<p>other horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the</p>
<p>royal court. There was great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to</p>
<p>meet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one</p>
<p>who was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber;</p>
<p>but the true princess was told to stay in the court below.</p>
<p>Now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he</p>
<p>amused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was</p>
<p>going on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty,</p>
<p>and too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber</p>
<p>to ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left</p>
<p>standing in the court below. ‘I brought her with me for the sake of her</p>
<p>company on the road,’ said she; ‘pray give the girl some work to do,</p>
<p>that she may not be idle.’ The old king could not for some time think</p>
<p>of any work for her to do; but at last he said, ‘I have a lad who takes</p>
<p>care of my geese; she may go and help him.’ Now the name of this lad,</p>
<p>that the real bride was to help in watching the king’s geese, was</p>
<p>Curdken.</p>
<p>But the false bride said to the prince, ‘Dear husband, pray do me one</p>
<p>piece of kindness.’ ‘That I will,’ said the prince. ‘Then tell one of</p>
<p>your slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it</p>
<p>was very unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road’; but the truth was,</p>
<p>she was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak, and</p>
<p>tell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point, and the</p>
<p>faithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she</p>
<p>wept, and begged the man to nail up Falada’s head against a large</p>
<p>dark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning</p>
<p>and evening, that there she might still see him sometimes. Then the</p>
<p>slaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the head, and</p>
<p>nailed it up under the dark gate.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate,</p>
<p>she said sorrowfully:</p>
<p>‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’</p>
<p>and the head answered:</p>
<p>‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!</p>
<p>Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,</p>
<p>Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’</p>
<p>Then they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she</p>
<p>came to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her</p>
<p>waving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken</p>
<p>saw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of the</p>
<p>locks out, but she cried:</p>
<p>‘Blow, breezes, blow!</p>
<p>Let Curdken’s hat go!</p>
<p>Blow, breezes, blow!</p>
<p>Let him after it go!</p>
<p>O’er hills, dales, and rocks,</p>
<p>Away be it whirl’d</p>
<p>Till the silvery locks</p>
<p>Are all comb’d and curl’d!</p>
<p>Then there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken’s hat; and</p>
<p>away it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after</p>
<p>it; till, by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her</p>
<p>hair, and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky,</p>
<p>and would not speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it</p>
<p>grew dark in the evening, and then drove them homewards.</p>
<p>The next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor</p>
<p>girl looked up at Falada’s head, and cried:</p>
<p>‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’</p>
<p>and the head answered:</p>
<p>‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!</p>
<p>Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,</p>
<p>Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’</p>
<p>Then she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and began</p>
<p>to comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her, and wanted to</p>
<p>take hold of it; but she cried out quickly:</p>
<p>‘Blow, breezes, blow!</p>
<p>Let Curdken’s hat go!</p>
<p>Blow, breezes, blow!</p>
<p>Let him after it go!</p>
<p>O’er hills, dales, and rocks,</p>
<p>Away be it whirl’d</p>
<p>Till the silvery locks</p>
<p>Are all comb’d and curl’d!</p>
<p>Then the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way,</p>
<p>over the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when</p>
<p>he came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So they</p>
<p>watched the geese till it grew dark.</p>
<p>In the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the old king, and</p>
<p>said, ‘I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any</p>
<p>longer.’ ‘Why?’ said the king. ‘Because, instead of doing any good, she</p>
<p>does nothing but tease me all day long.’ Then the king made him tell him</p>
<p>what had happened. And Curdken said, ‘When we go in the morning through</p>
<p>the dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with the head</p>
<p>of a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:</p>
<p>‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’</p>
<p>and the head answers:</p>
<p>‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!</p>
<p>Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,</p>
<p>Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’</p>
<p>And Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow</p>
<p>where the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he was forced</p>
<p>to run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But the</p>
<p>old king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning</p>
<p>came, he placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how she spoke</p>
<p>to Falada, and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field, and</p>
<p>hid himself in a bush by the meadow’s side; and he soon saw with his own</p>
<p>eyes how they drove the flock of geese; and how, after a little time,</p>
<p>she let down her hair that glittered in the sun. And then he heard her</p>
<p>say:</p>
<p>‘Blow, breezes, blow!</p>
<p>Let Curdken’s hat go!</p>
<p>Blow, breezes, blow!</p>
<p>Let him after it go!</p>
<p>O’er hills, dales, and rocks,</p>
<p>Away be it whirl’d</p>
<p>Till the silvery locks</p>
<p>Are all comb’d and curl’d!</p>
<p>And soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken’s hat, and away</p>
<p>went Curdken after it, while the girl went on combing and curling her</p>
<p>hair. All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen; and</p>
<p>when the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her aside,</p>
<p>and asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and said, ‘That</p>
<p>I must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.’</p>
<p>But the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had told</p>
<p>him all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it was very</p>
<p>lucky for her that she did so, for when she had done the king ordered</p>
<p>royal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was</p>
<p>so beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that he had only a</p>
<p>false bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the true</p>
<p>bride stood by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and</p>
<p>heard how meek and patient she had been; and without saying anything to</p>
<p>the false bride, the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all</p>
<p>his court. The bridegroom sat at the top, with the false princess on one</p>
<p>side, and the true one on the other; but nobody knew her again, for her</p>
<p>beauty was quite dazzling to their eyes; and she did not seem at all</p>
<p>like the little goose-girl, now that she had her brilliant dress on.</p>
<p>When they had eaten and drank, and were very merry, the old king said</p>
<p>he would tell them a tale. So he began, and told all the story of the</p>
<p>princess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the</p>
<p>true waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would</p>
<p>behave thus. ‘Nothing better,’ said this false bride, ‘than that she</p>
<p>should be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that</p>
<p>two white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from street to</p>
<p>street till she was dead.’ ‘Thou art she!’ said the old king; ‘and as</p>
<p>thou has judged thyself, so shall it be done to thee.’ And the young</p>
<p>king was then married to his true wife, and they reigned over the</p>
<p>kingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good fairy came</p>
<p>to see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life again.</p>
