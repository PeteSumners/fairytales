            <p>Some men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes</p>
<p>right--all that falls to them is so much gain--all their geese are</p>
<p>swans--all their cards are trumps--toss them which way you will, they</p>
<p>will always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so</p>
<p>much the faster. The world may very likely not always think of them as</p>
<p>they think of themselves, but what care they for the world? what can it</p>
<p>know about the matter?</p>
<p>One of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans. Seven long years he had</p>
<p>worked hard for his master. At last he said, ‘Master, my time is up; I</p>
<p>must go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages</p>
<p>and let me go.’ And the master said, ‘You have been a faithful and good</p>
<p>servant, Hans, so your pay shall be handsome.’ Then he gave him a lump</p>
<p>of silver as big as his head.</p>
<p>Hans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it,</p>
<p>threw it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards. As he</p>
<p>went lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight,</p>
<p>trotting gaily along on a capital horse. ‘Ah!’ said Hans aloud, ‘what a</p>
<p>fine thing it is to ride on horseback! There he sits as easy and happy</p>
<p>as if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no</p>
<p>stones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows how.’ Hans did</p>
<p>not speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, ‘Well,</p>
<p>friend, why do you go on foot then?’ ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘I have this load to</p>
<p>carry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can’t hold up</p>
<p>my head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.’ ‘What do you say</p>
<p>of making an exchange?’ said the horseman. ‘I will give you my horse,</p>
<p>and you shall give me the silver; which will save you a great deal of</p>
<p>trouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you.’ ‘With all my</p>
<p>heart,’ said Hans: ‘but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one</p>
<p>thing--you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.’</p>
<p>However, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him</p>
<p>the bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, ‘When</p>
<p>you want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry</p>
<p>“Jip!”’</p>
<p>Hans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his</p>
<p>elbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one</p>
<p>minute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,</p>
<p>‘No care and no sorrow,</p>
<p>A fig for the morrow!</p>
<p>We’ll laugh and be merry,</p>
<p>Sing neigh down derry!’</p>
<p>After a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he</p>
<p>smacked his lips and cried ‘Jip!’ Away went the horse full gallop; and</p>
<p>before Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his</p>
<p>back by the road-side. His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who</p>
<p>was coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it. Hans soon came to</p>
<p>himself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed, and said to the</p>
<p>shepherd, ‘This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon</p>
<p>a beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break</p>
<p>his neck. However, I’m off now once for all: I like your cow now a great</p>
<p>deal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has</p>
<p>spoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells</p>
<p>not very like a nosegay. One can walk along at one’s leisure behind that</p>
<p>cow--keep good company, and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day,</p>
<p>into the bargain. What would I give to have such a prize!’ ‘Well,’ said</p>
<p>the shepherd, ‘if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your</p>
<p>horse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it</p>
<p>myself.’ ‘Done!’ said Hans, merrily. ‘What a noble heart that good man</p>
<p>has!’ thought he. Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse, wished Hans</p>
<p>and the cow good morning, and away he rode.</p>
<p>Hans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and</p>
<p>then drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky</p>
<p>one. ‘If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be</p>
<p>able to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with</p>
<p>it; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what</p>
<p>can I wish for more?’ When he came to an inn, he halted, ate up all his</p>
<p>bread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer. When he had</p>
<p>rested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother’s</p>
<p>village. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at</p>
<p>last, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than</p>
<p>an hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue</p>
<p>clave to the roof of his mouth. ‘I can find a cure for this,’ thought</p>
<p>he; ‘now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst’: so he tied her to the</p>
<p>stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop</p>
<p>was to be had. Who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring</p>
<p>him milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry? Hans had</p>
<p>not thought of looking to that.</p>
<p>While he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very</p>
<p>clumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at</p>
<p>last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he</p>
<p>lay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a</p>
<p>pig in a wheelbarrow. ‘What is the matter with you, my man?’ said the</p>
<p>butcher, as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened, how he</p>
<p>was dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too. Then</p>
<p>the butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, ‘There, drink and refresh</p>
<p>yourself; your cow will give you no milk: don’t you see she is an old</p>
<p>beast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?’ ‘Alas, alas!’ said</p>
<p>Hans, ‘who would have thought it? What a shame to take my horse, and</p>
<p>give me only a dry cow! If I kill her, what will she be good for? I hate</p>
<p>cow-beef; it is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig now--like</p>
<p>that fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease--one could do</p>
<p>something with it; it would at any rate make sausages.’ ‘Well,’ said</p>
<p>the butcher, ‘I don’t like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind,</p>
<p>neighbourly thing. To please you I will change, and give you my fine fat</p>
<p>pig for the cow.’ ‘Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!’</p>
<p>said Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the</p>
<p>wheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to</p>
<p>its leg.</p>
<p>So on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met</p>
<p>with some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all.</p>
<p>How could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at</p>
<p>last got?</p>
<p>The next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose. The</p>
<p>countryman stopped to ask what was o’clock; this led to further chat;</p>
<p>and Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and</p>
<p>how all the world went gay and smiling with him. The countryman then</p>
<p>began to tell his tale, and said he was going to take the goose to a</p>
<p>christening. ‘Feel,’ said he, ‘how heavy it is, and yet it is only eight</p>
<p>weeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it,</p>
<p>it has lived so well!’ ‘You’re right,’ said Hans, as he weighed it in</p>
<p>his hand; ‘but if you talk of fat, my pig is no trifle.’ Meantime the</p>
<p>countryman began to look grave, and shook his head. ‘Hark ye!’ said he,</p>
<p>‘my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so I can’t help doing</p>
<p>you a kind turn. Your pig may get you into a scrape. In the village I</p>
<p>just came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty. I was</p>
<p>dreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squire’s pig. If</p>
<p>you have, and they catch you, it will be a bad job for you. The least</p>
<p>they will do will be to throw you into the horse-pond. Can you swim?’</p>
<p>Poor Hans was sadly frightened. ‘Good man,’ cried he, ‘pray get me out</p>
<p>of this scrape. I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or born;</p>
<p>but he may have been the squire’s for aught I can tell: you know this</p>
<p>country better than I do, take my pig and give me the goose.’ ‘I ought</p>
<p>to have something into the bargain,’ said the countryman; ‘give a fat</p>
<p>goose for a pig, indeed! ‘Tis not everyone would do so much for you as</p>
<p>that. However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.’ Then</p>
<p>he took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path;</p>
<p>while Hans went on the way homewards free from care. ‘After all,’</p>
<p>thought he, ‘that chap is pretty well taken in. I don’t care whose pig</p>
<p>it is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me. I</p>
<p>have much the best of the bargain. First there will be a capital roast;</p>
<p>then the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months; and then there</p>
<p>are all the beautiful white feathers. I will put them into my pillow,</p>
<p>and then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking. How happy my</p>
<p>mother will be! Talk of a pig, indeed! Give me a fine fat goose.’</p>
<p>As he came to the next village, he saw a scissor-grinder with his wheel,</p>
<p>working and singing,</p>
<p>‘O’er hill and o’er dale</p>
<p>So happy I roam,</p>
<p>Work light and live well,</p>
<p>All the world is my home;</p>
<p>Then who so blythe, so merry as I?’</p>
<p>Hans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, ‘You must be well</p>
<p>off, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work.’ ‘Yes,’ said the</p>
<p>other, ‘mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand</p>
<p>into his pocket without finding money in it--but where did you get that</p>
<p>beautiful goose?’ ‘I did not buy it, I gave a pig for it.’ ‘And where</p>
<p>did you get the pig?’ ‘I gave a cow for it.’ ‘And the cow?’ ‘I gave a</p>
<p>horse for it.’ ‘And the horse?’ ‘I gave a lump of silver as big as my</p>
<p>head for it.’ ‘And the silver?’ ‘Oh! I worked hard for that seven long</p>
<p>years.’ ‘You have thriven well in the world hitherto,’ said the grinder,</p>
<p>‘now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your hand</p>
<p>in it, your fortune would be made.’ ‘Very true: but how is that to be</p>
<p>managed?’ ‘How? Why, you must turn grinder like myself,’ said the other;</p>
<p>‘you only want a grindstone; the rest will come of itself. Here is one</p>
<p>that is but little the worse for wear: I would not ask more than the</p>
<p>value of your goose for it--will you buy?’ ‘How can you ask?’ said</p>
<p>Hans; ‘I should be the happiest man in the world, if I could have money</p>
<p>whenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I want more? there’s</p>
<p>the goose.’ ‘Now,’ said the grinder, as he gave him a common rough stone</p>
<p>that lay by his side, ‘this is a most capital stone; do but work it well</p>
<p>enough, and you can make an old nail cut with it.’</p>
<p>Hans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes</p>
<p>sparkled for joy, and he said to himself, ‘Surely I must have been born</p>
<p>in a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself.</p>
<p>People are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a favour in</p>
<p>letting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains.’</p>
<p>Meantime he began to be tired, and hungry too, for he had given away his</p>
<p>last penny in his joy at getting the cow.</p>
<p>At last he could go no farther, for the stone tired him sadly: and he</p>
<p>dragged himself to the side of a river, that he might take a drink of</p>
<p>water, and rest a while. So he laid the stone carefully by his side on</p>
<p>the bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a</p>
<p>little, and down it rolled, plump into the stream.</p>
<p>For a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang</p>
<p>up and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven,</p>
<p>with tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his only plague,</p>
<p>the ugly heavy stone.</p>
<p>‘How happy am I!’ cried he; ‘nobody was ever so lucky as I.’ Then up he</p>
<p>got with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till</p>
<p>he reached his mother’s house, and told her how very easy the road to</p>
<p>good luck was.</p>
