            <p>There was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that</p>
<p>his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test. He</p>
<p>stretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved</p>
<p>as if he were stone dead. Mrs Fox went up to her room, shut herself in,</p>
<p>and her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking. When it</p>
<p>became known that the old fox was dead, suitors presented themselves.</p>
<p>The maid heard someone standing at the house-door, knocking. She went</p>
<p>and opened it, and it was a young fox, who said:</p>
<p>‘What may you be about, Miss Cat?</p>
<p>Do you sleep or do you wake?’</p>
<p>She answered:</p>
<p>‘I am not sleeping, I am waking,</p>
<p>Would you know what I am making?</p>
<p>I am boiling warm beer with butter,</p>
<p>Will you be my guest for supper?’</p>
<p>‘No, thank you, miss,’ said the fox, ‘what is Mrs Fox doing?’ The maid</p>
<p>replied:</p>
<p>‘She is sitting in her room,</p>
<p>Moaning in her gloom,</p>
<p>Weeping her little eyes quite red,</p>
<p>Because old Mr Fox is dead.’</p>
<p>‘Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo</p>
<p>her.’ ‘Certainly, young sir.’</p>
<p>The cat goes up the stairs trip, trap,</p>
<p>The door she knocks at tap, tap, tap,</p>
<p>‘Mistress Fox, are you inside?’</p>
<p>‘Oh, yes, my little cat,’ she cried.</p>
<p>‘A wooer he stands at the door out there.’</p>
<p>‘What does he look like, my dear?’</p>
<p>‘Has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr Fox?’ ‘Oh, no,’ answered</p>
<p>the cat, ‘he has only one.’ ‘Then I will not have him.’</p>
<p>Miss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away. Soon afterwards there</p>
<p>was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs</p>
<p>Fox. He had two tails, but he did not fare better than the first. After</p>
<p>this still more came, each with one tail more than the other, but they</p>
<p>were all turned away, until at last one came who had nine tails, like</p>
<p>old Mr Fox. When the widow heard that, she said joyfully to the cat:</p>
<p>‘Now open the gates and doors all wide,</p>
<p>And carry old Mr Fox outside.’</p>
<p>But just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old Mr Fox stirred</p>
<p>under the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and Mrs</p>
<p>Fox out of the house.</p>
