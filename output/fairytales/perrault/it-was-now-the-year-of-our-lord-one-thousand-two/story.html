        <div class="story-content">
            <p>seventy-two; and Prince Edward, the heir to the throne, being away in</p>
<p>the Holy Land, knew nothing of his father’s death. The Barons, however,</p>
<p>proclaimed him King, immediately after the Royal funeral; and the</p>
<p>people very willingly consented, since most men knew too well by this</p>
<p>time what the horrors of a contest for the crown were. So King Edward</p>
<p>the First, called, in a not very complimentary manner, Longshanks,</p>
<p>because of the slenderness of his legs, was peacefully accepted by the</p>
<p>English Nation.</p>
<p>His legs had need to be strong, however long and thin they were; for</p>
<p>they had to support him through many difficulties on the fiery sands of</p>
<p>Asia, where his small force of soldiers fainted, died, deserted, and</p>
<p>seemed to melt away. But his prowess made light of it, and he said, ‘I</p>
<p>will go on, if I go on with no other follower than my groom!’</p>
<p>A Prince of this spirit gave the Turks a deal of trouble. He stormed</p>
<p>Nazareth, at which place, of all places on earth, I am sorry to relate,</p>
<p>he made a frightful slaughter of innocent people; and then he went to</p>
<p>Acre, where he got a truce of ten years from the Sultan. He had very</p>
<p>nearly lost his life in Acre, through the treachery of a Saracen Noble,</p>
<p>called the Emir of Jaffa, who, making the pretence that he had some</p>
<p>idea of turning Christian and wanted to know all about that religion,</p>
<p>sent a trusty messenger to Edward very often—with a dagger in his</p>
<p>sleeve. At last, one Friday in Whitsun week, when it was very hot, and</p>
<p>all the sandy prospect lay beneath the blazing sun, burnt up like a</p>
<p>great overdone biscuit, and Edward was lying on a couch, dressed for</p>
<p>coolness in only a loose robe, the messenger, with his</p>
<p>chocolate-coloured face and his bright dark eyes and white teeth, came</p>
<p>creeping in with a letter, and kneeled down like a tame tiger. But, the</p>
<p>moment Edward stretched out his hand to take the letter, the tiger made</p>
<p>a spring at his heart. He was quick, but Edward was quick too. He</p>
<p>seized the traitor by his chocolate throat, threw him to the ground,</p>
<p>and slew him with the very dagger he had drawn. The weapon had struck</p>
<p>Edward in the arm, and although the wound itself was slight, it</p>
<p>threatened to be mortal, for the blade of the dagger had been smeared</p>
<p>with poison. Thanks, however, to a better surgeon than was often to be</p>
<p>found in those times, and to some wholesome herbs, and above all, to</p>
<p>his faithful wife, Eleanor, who devotedly nursed him, and is said by</p>
<p>some to have sucked the poison from the wound with her own red lips</p>
<p>(which I am very willing to believe), Edward soon recovered and was</p>
<p>sound again.</p>
<p>As the King his father had sent entreaties to him to return home, he</p>
<p>now began the journey. He had got as far as Italy, when he met</p>
<p>messengers who brought him intelligence of the King’s death. Hearing</p>
<p>that all was quiet at home, he made no haste to return to his own</p>
<p>dominions, but paid a visit to the Pope, and went in state through</p>
<p>various Italian Towns, where he was welcomed with acclamations as a</p>
<p>mighty champion of the Cross from the Holy Land, and where he received</p>
<p>presents of purple mantles and prancing horses, and went along in great</p>
<p>triumph. The shouting people little knew that he was the last English</p>
<p>monarch who would ever embark in a crusade, or that within twenty years</p>
<p>every conquest which the Christians had made in the Holy Land at the</p>
<p>cost of so much blood, would be won back by the Turks. But all this</p>
<p>came to pass.</p>
<p>There was, and there is, an old town standing in a plain in France,</p>
<p>called Châlons. When the King was coming towards this place on his way</p>
<p>to England, a wily French Lord, called the Count of Châlons, sent him a</p>
<p>polite challenge to come with his knights and hold a fair tournament</p>
<p>with the Count and _his_ knights, and make a day of it with sword and</p>
<p>lance. It was represented to the King that the Count of Châlons was not</p>
<p>to be trusted, and that, instead of a holiday fight for mere show and</p>
<p>in good humour, he secretly meant a real battle, in which the English</p>
<p>should be defeated by superior force.</p>
<p>The King, however, nothing afraid, went to the appointed place on the</p>
<p>appointed day with a thousand followers. When the Count came with two</p>
<p>thousand and attacked the English in earnest, the English rushed at</p>
<p>them with such valour that the Count’s men and the Count’s horses soon</p>
<p>began to be tumbled down all over the field. The Count himself seized</p>
<p>the King round the neck, but the King tumbled _him_ out of his saddle</p>
<p>in return for the compliment, and, jumping from his own horse, and</p>
<p>standing over him, beat away at his iron armour like a blacksmith</p>
<p>hammering on his anvil. Even when the Count owned himself defeated and</p>
<p>offered his sword, the King would not do him the honour to take it, but</p>
<p>made him yield it up to a common soldier. There had been such fury</p>
<p>shown in this fight, that it was afterwards called the little Battle of</p>
<p>Châlons.</p>
<p>The English were very well disposed to be proud of their King after</p>
<p>these adventures; so, when he landed at Dover in the year one thousand</p>
<p>two hundred and seventy-four (being then thirty-six years old), and</p>
<p>went on to Westminster where he and his good Queen were crowned with</p>
<p>great magnificence, splendid rejoicings took place. For the</p>
<p>coronation-feast there were provided, among other eatables, four</p>
<p>hundred oxen, four hundred sheep, four hundred and fifty pigs, eighteen</p>
<p>wild boars, three hundred flitches of bacon, and twenty thousand fowls.</p>
<p>The fountains and conduits in the street flowed with red and white wine</p>
<p>instead of water; the rich citizens hung silks and cloths of the</p>
<p>brightest colours out of their windows to increase the beauty of the</p>
<p>show, and threw out gold and silver by whole handfuls to make scrambles</p>
<p>for the crowd. In short, there was such eating and drinking, such music</p>
<p>and capering, such a ringing of bells and tossing of caps, such a</p>
<p>shouting, and singing, and revelling, as the narrow overhanging streets</p>
<p>of old London City had not witnessed for many a long day. All the</p>
<p>people were merry except the poor Jews, who, trembling within their</p>
<p>houses, and scarcely daring to peep out, began to foresee that they</p>
<p>would have to find the money for this joviality sooner or later.</p>
<p>To dismiss this sad subject of the Jews for the present, I am sorry to</p>
<p>add that in this reign they were most unmercifully pillaged. They were</p>
<p>hanged in great numbers, on accusations of having clipped the King’s</p>
<p>coin—which all kinds of people had done. They were heavily taxed; they</p>
<p>were disgracefully badged; they were, on one day, thirteen years after</p>
<p>the coronation, taken up with their wives and children and thrown into</p>
<p>beastly prisons, until they purchased their release by paying to the</p>
<p>King twelve thousand pounds. Finally, every kind of property belonging</p>
<p>to them was seized by the King, except so little as would defray the</p>
<p>charge of their taking themselves away into foreign countries. Many</p>
<p>years elapsed before the hope of gain induced any of their race to</p>
<p>return to England, where they had been treated so heartlessly and had</p>
<p>suffered so much.</p>
<p>If King Edward the First had been as bad a king to Christians as he was</p>
<p>to Jews, he would have been bad indeed. But he was, in general, a wise</p>
<p>and great monarch, under whom the country much improved. He had no love</p>
<p>for the Great Charter—few Kings had, through many, many years—but he</p>
<p>had high qualities. The first bold object which he conceived when he</p>
<p>came home, was, to unite under one Sovereign England, Scotland, and</p>
<p>Wales; the two last of which countries had each a little king of its</p>
<p>own, about whom the people were always quarrelling and fighting, and</p>
<p>making a prodigious disturbance—a great deal more than he was worth. In</p>
<p>the course of King Edward’s reign he was engaged, besides, in a war</p>
<p>with France. To make these quarrels clearer, we will separate their</p>
<p>histories and take them thus. Wales, first. France, second. Scotland,</p>
<p>third.</p>
<p>Llewellyn was the Prince of Wales. He had been on the side of the</p>
<p>Barons in the reign of the stupid old King, but had afterwards sworn</p>
<p>allegiance to him. When King Edward came to the throne, Llewellyn was</p>
<p>required to swear allegiance to him also; which he refused to do. The</p>
<p>King, being crowned and in his own dominions, three times more required</p>
<p>Llewellyn to come and do homage; and three times more Llewellyn said he</p>
<p>would rather not. He was going to be married to Eleanor de Montfort, a</p>
<p>young lady of the family mentioned in the last reign; and it chanced</p>
<p>that this young lady, coming from France with her youngest brother,</p>
<p>Emeric, was taken by an English ship, and was ordered by the English</p>
<p>King to be detained. Upon this, the quarrel came to a head. The King</p>
<p>went, with his fleet, to the coast of Wales, where, so encompassing</p>
<p>Llewellyn, that he could only take refuge in the bleak mountain region</p>
<p>of Snowdon in which no provisions could reach him, he was soon starved</p>
<p>into an apology, and into a treaty of peace, and into paying the</p>
<p>expenses of the war. The King, however, forgave him some of the hardest</p>
<p>conditions of the treaty, and consented to his marriage. And he now</p>
<p>thought he had reduced Wales to obedience.</p>
<p>But the Welsh, although they were naturally a gentle, quiet, pleasant</p>
<p>people, who liked to receive strangers in their cottages among the</p>
<p>mountains, and to set before them with free hospitality whatever they</p>
<p>had to eat and drink, and to play to them on their harps, and sing</p>
<p>their native ballads to them, were a people of great spirit when their</p>
<p>blood was up. Englishmen, after this affair, began to be insolent in</p>
<p>Wales, and to assume the air of masters; and the Welsh pride could not</p>
<p>bear it. Moreover, they believed in that unlucky old Merlin, some of</p>
<p>whose unlucky old prophecies somebody always seemed doomed to remember</p>
<p>when there was a chance of its doing harm; and just at this time some</p>
<p>blind old gentleman with a harp and a long white beard, who was an</p>
<p>excellent person, but had become of an unknown age and tedious, burst</p>
<p>out with a declaration that Merlin had predicted that when English</p>
<p>money had become round, a Prince of Wales would be crowned in London.</p>
<p>Now, King Edward had recently forbidden the English penny to be cut</p>
<p>into halves and quarters for halfpence and farthings, and had actually</p>
<p>introduced a round coin; therefore, the Welsh people said this was the</p>
<p>time Merlin meant, and rose accordingly.</p>
<p>King Edward had bought over Prince David, Llewellyn’s brother, by</p>
<p>heaping favours upon him; but he was the first to revolt, being perhaps</p>
<p>troubled in his conscience. One stormy night, he surprised the Castle</p>
<p>of Hawarden, in possession of which an English nobleman had been left;</p>
<p>killed the whole garrison, and carried off the nobleman a prisoner to</p>
<p>Snowdon. Upon this, the Welsh people rose like one man. King Edward,</p>
<p>with his army, marching from Worcester to the Menai Strait, crossed</p>
<p>it—near to where the wonderful tubular iron bridge now, in days so</p>
<p>different, makes a passage for railway trains—by a bridge of boats that</p>
<p>enabled forty men to march abreast. He subdued the Island of Anglesea,</p>
<p>and sent his men forward to observe the enemy. The sudden appearance of</p>
<p>the Welsh created a panic among them, and they fell back to the bridge.</p>
<p>The tide had in the meantime risen and separated the boats; the Welsh</p>
<p>pursuing them, they were driven into the sea, and there they sunk, in</p>
<p>their heavy iron armour, by thousands. After this victory Llewellyn,</p>
<p>helped by the severe winter-weather of Wales, gained another battle;</p>
<p>but the King ordering a portion of his English army to advance through</p>
<p>South Wales, and catch him between two foes, and Llewellyn bravely</p>
<p>turning to meet this new enemy, he was surprised and killed—very</p>
<p>meanly, for he was unarmed and defenceless. His head was struck off and</p>
<p>sent to London, where it was fixed upon the Tower, encircled with a</p>
<p>wreath, some say of ivy, some say of willow, some say of silver, to</p>
<p>make it look like a ghastly coin in ridicule of the prediction.</p>
<p>David, however, still held out for six months, though eagerly sought</p>
<p>after by the King, and hunted by his own countrymen. One of them</p>
<p>finally betrayed him with his wife and children. He was sentenced to be</p>
<p>hanged, drawn, and quartered; and from that time this became the</p>
<p>established punishment of Traitors in England—a punishment wholly</p>
<p>without excuse, as being revolting, vile, and cruel, after its object</p>
<p>is dead; and which has no sense in it, as its only real degradation</p>
<p>(and that nothing can blot out) is to the country that permits on any</p>
<p>consideration such abominable barbarity.</p>
<p>Wales was now subdued. The Queen giving birth to a young prince in the</p>
<p>Castle of Carnarvon, the King showed him to the Welsh people as their</p>
<p>countryman, and called him Prince of Wales; a title that has ever since</p>
<p>been borne by the heir-apparent to the English throne—which that little</p>
<p>Prince soon became, by the death of his elder brother. The King did</p>
<p>better things for the Welsh than that, by improving their laws and</p>
<p>encouraging their trade. Disturbances still took place, chiefly</p>
<p>occasioned by the avarice and pride of the English Lords, on whom Welsh</p>
<p>lands and castles had been bestowed; but they were subdued, and the</p>
<p>country never rose again. There is a legend that to prevent the people</p>
<p>from being incited to rebellion by the songs of their bards and</p>
<p>harpers, Edward had them all put to death. Some of them may have fallen</p>
<p>among other men who held out against the King; but this general</p>
<p>slaughter is, I think, a fancy of the harpers themselves, who, I dare</p>
<p>say, made a song about it many years afterwards, and sang it by the</p>
<p>Welsh firesides until it came to be believed.</p>
<p>The foreign war of the reign of Edward the First arose in this way. The</p>
<p>crews of two vessels, one a Norman ship, and the other an English ship,</p>
<p>happened to go to the same place in their boats to fill their casks</p>
<p>with fresh water. Being rough angry fellows, they began to quarrel, and</p>
<p>then to fight—the English with their fists; the Normans with their</p>
<p>knives—and, in the fight, a Norman was killed. The Norman crew, instead</p>
<p>of revenging themselves upon those English sailors with whom they had</p>
<p>quarrelled (who were too strong for them, I suspect), took to their</p>
<p>ship again in a great rage, attacked the first English ship they met,</p>
<p>laid hold of an unoffending merchant who happened to be on board, and</p>
<p>brutally hanged him in the rigging of their own vessel with a dog at</p>
<p>his feet. This so enraged the English sailors that there was no</p>
<p>restraining them; and whenever, and wherever, English sailors met</p>
<p>Norman sailors, they fell upon each other tooth and nail. The Irish and</p>
<p>Dutch sailors took part with the English; the French and Genoese</p>
<p>sailors helped the Normans; and thus the greater part of the mariners</p>
<p>sailing over the sea became, in their way, as violent and raging as the</p>
<p>sea itself when it is disturbed.</p>
<p>King Edward’s fame had been so high abroad that he had been chosen to</p>
<p>decide a difference between France and another foreign power, and had</p>
<p>lived upon the Continent three years. At first, neither he nor the</p>
<p>French King Philip (the good Louis had been dead some time) interfered</p>
<p>in these quarrels; but when a fleet of eighty English ships engaged and</p>
<p>utterly defeated a Norman fleet of two hundred, in a pitched battle</p>
<p>fought round a ship at anchor, in which no quarter was given, the</p>
<p>matter became too serious to be passed over. King Edward, as Duke of</p>
<p>Guienne, was summoned to present himself before the King of France, at</p>
<p>Paris, and answer for the damage done by his sailor subjects. At first,</p>
<p>he sent the Bishop of London as his representative, and then his</p>
<p>brother Edmund, who was married to the French Queen’s mother. I am</p>
<p>afraid Edmund was an easy man, and allowed himself to be talked over by</p>
<p>his charming relations, the French court ladies; at all events, he was</p>
<p>induced to give up his brother’s dukedom for forty days—as a mere form,</p>
<p>the French King said, to satisfy his honour—and he was so very much</p>
<p>astonished, when the time was out, to find that the French King had no</p>
<p>idea of giving it up again, that I should not wonder if it hastened his</p>
<p>death: which soon took place.</p>
<p>King Edward was a King to win his foreign dukedom back again, if it</p>
<p>could be won by energy and valour. He raised a large army, renounced</p>
<p>his allegiance as Duke of Guienne, and crossed the sea to carry war</p>
<p>into France. Before any important battle was fought, however, a truce</p>
<p>was agreed upon for two years; and in the course of that time, the Pope</p>
<p>effected a reconciliation. King Edward, who was now a widower, having</p>
<p>lost his affectionate and good wife, Eleanor, married the French King’s</p>
<p>sister, Margaret; and the Prince of Wales was contracted to the French</p>
<p>King’s daughter Isabella.</p>
<p>Out of bad things, good things sometimes arise. Out of this hanging of</p>
<p>the innocent merchant, and the bloodshed and strife it caused, there</p>
<p>came to be established one of the greatest powers that the English</p>
<p>people now possess. The preparations for the war being very expensive,</p>
<p>and King Edward greatly wanting money, and being very arbitrary in his</p>
<p>ways of raising it, some of the Barons began firmly to oppose him. Two</p>
<p>of them, in particular, Humphrey Bohun, Earl of Hereford, and Roger</p>
<p>Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, were so stout against him, that they maintained</p>
<p>he had no right to command them to head his forces in Guienne, and</p>
<p>flatly refused to go there. ‘By Heaven, Sir Earl,’ said the King to the</p>
<p>Earl of Hereford, in a great passion, ‘you shall either go or be</p>
<p>hanged!’ ‘By Heaven, Sir King,’ replied the Earl, ‘I will neither go</p>
<p>nor yet will I be hanged!’ and both he and the other Earl sturdily left</p>
<p>the court, attended by many Lords. The King tried every means of</p>
<p>raising money. He taxed the clergy, in spite of all the Pope said to</p>
<p>the contrary; and when they refused to pay, reduced them to submission,</p>
<p>by saying Very well, then they had no claim upon the government for</p>
<p>protection, and any man might plunder them who would—which a good many</p>
<p>men were very ready to do, and very readily did, and which the clergy</p>
<p>found too losing a game to be played at long. He seized all the wool</p>
<p>and leather in the hands of the merchants, promising to pay for it some</p>
<p>fine day; and he set a tax upon the exportation of wool, which was so</p>
<p>unpopular among the traders that it was called ‘The evil toll.’ But all</p>
<p>would not do. The Barons, led by those two great Earls, declared any</p>
<p>taxes imposed without the consent of Parliament, unlawful; and the</p>
<p>Parliament refused to impose taxes, until the King should confirm</p>
<p>afresh the two Great Charters, and should solemnly declare in writing,</p>
<p>that there was no power in the country to raise money from the people,</p>
<p>evermore, but the power of Parliament representing all ranks of the</p>
<p>people. The King was very unwilling to diminish his own power by</p>
<p>allowing this great privilege in the Parliament; but there was no help</p>
<p>for it, and he at last complied. We shall come to another King</p>
<p>by-and-by, who might have saved his head from rolling off, if he had</p>
<p>profited by this example.</p>
<p>The people gained other benefits in Parliament from the good sense and</p>
<p>wisdom of this King. Many of the laws were much improved; provision was</p>
<p>made for the greater safety of travellers, and the apprehension of</p>
<p>thieves and murderers; the priests were prevented from holding too much</p>
<p>land, and so becoming too powerful; and Justices of the Peace were</p>
<p>first appointed (though not at first under that name) in various parts</p>
<p>of the country.</p>
<p>And now we come to Scotland, which was the great and lasting trouble of</p>
<p>the reign of King Edward the First.</p>
<p>About thirteen years after King Edward’s coronation, Alexander the</p>
<p>Third, the King of Scotland, died of a fall from his horse. He had been</p>
<p>married to Margaret, King Edward’s sister. All their children being</p>
<p>dead, the Scottish crown became the right of a young Princess only</p>
<p>eight years old, the daughter of Eric, King of Norway, who had married</p>
<p>a daughter of the deceased sovereign. King Edward proposed, that the</p>
<p>Maiden of Norway, as this Princess was called, should be engaged to be</p>
<p>married to his eldest son; but, unfortunately, as she was coming over</p>
<p>to England she fell sick, and landing on one of the Orkney Islands,</p>
<p>died there. A great commotion immediately began in Scotland, where as</p>
<p>many as thirteen noisy claimants to the vacant throne started up and</p>
<p>made a general confusion.</p>
<p>King Edward being much renowned for his sagacity and justice, it seems</p>
<p>to have been agreed to refer the dispute to him. He accepted the trust,</p>
<p>and went, with an army, to the Border-land where England and Scotland</p>
<p>joined. There, he called upon the Scottish gentlemen to meet him at the</p>
<p>Castle of Norham, on the English side of the river Tweed; and to that</p>
<p>Castle they came. But, before he would take any step in the business,</p>
<p>he required those Scottish gentlemen, one and all, to do homage to him</p>
<p>as their superior Lord; and when they hesitated, he said, ‘By holy</p>
<p>Edward, whose crown I wear, I will have my rights, or I will die in</p>
<p>maintaining them!’ The Scottish gentlemen, who had not expected this,</p>
<p>were disconcerted, and asked for three weeks to think about it.</p>
<p>At the end of the three weeks, another meeting took place, on a green</p>
<p>plain on the Scottish side of the river. Of all the competitors for the</p>
<p>Scottish throne, there were only two who had any real claim, in right</p>
<p>of their near kindred to the Royal Family. These were John Baliol and</p>
<p>Robert Bruce: and the right was, I have no doubt, on the side of John</p>
<p>Baliol. At this particular meeting John Baliol was not present, but</p>
<p>Robert Bruce was; and on Robert Bruce being formally asked whether he</p>
<p>acknowledged the King of England for his superior lord, he answered,</p>
<p>plainly and distinctly, Yes, he did. Next day, John Baliol appeared,</p>
<p>and said the same. This point settled, some arrangements were made for</p>
<p>inquiring into their titles.</p>
<p>The inquiry occupied a pretty long time—more than a year. While it was</p>
<p>going on, King Edward took the opportunity of making a journey through</p>
<p>Scotland, and calling upon the Scottish people of all degrees to</p>
<p>acknowledge themselves his vassals, or be imprisoned until they did. In</p>
<p>the meanwhile, Commissioners were appointed to conduct the inquiry, a</p>
<p>Parliament was held at Berwick about it, the two claimants were heard</p>
<p>at full length, and there was a vast amount of talking. At last, in the</p>
<p>great hall of the Castle of Berwick, the King gave judgment in favour</p>
<p>of John Baliol: who, consenting to receive his crown by the King of</p>
<p>England’s favour and permission, was crowned at Scone, in an old stone</p>
<p>chair which had been used for ages in the abbey there, at the</p>
<p>coronations of Scottish Kings. Then, King Edward caused the great seal</p>
<p>of Scotland, used since the late King’s death, to be broken in four</p>
<p>pieces, and placed in the English Treasury; and considered that he now</p>
<p>had Scotland (according to the common saying) under his thumb.</p>
<p>Scotland had a strong will of its own yet, however. King Edward,</p>
<p>determined that the Scottish King should not forget he was his vassal,</p>
<p>summoned him repeatedly to come and defend himself and his judges</p>
<p>before the English Parliament when appeals from the decisions of</p>
<p>Scottish courts of justice were being heard. At length, John Baliol,</p>
<p>who had no great heart of his own, had so much heart put into him by</p>
<p>the brave spirit of the Scottish people, who took this as a national</p>
<p>insult, that he refused to come any more. Thereupon, the King further</p>
<p>required him to help him in his war abroad (which was then in</p>
<p>progress), and to give up, as security for his good behaviour in</p>
<p>future, the three strong Scottish Castles of Jedburgh, Roxburgh, and</p>
<p>Berwick. Nothing of this being done; on the contrary, the Scottish</p>
<p>people concealing their King among their mountains in the Highlands and</p>
<p>showing a determination to resist; Edward marched to Berwick with an</p>
<p>army of thirty thousand foot, and four thousand horse; took the Castle,</p>
<p>and slew its whole garrison, and the inhabitants of the town as</p>
<p>well—men, women, and children. Lord Warrenne, Earl of Surrey, then went</p>
<p>on to the Castle of Dunbar, before which a battle was fought, and the</p>
<p>whole Scottish army defeated with great slaughter. The victory being</p>
<p>complete, the Earl of Surrey was left as guardian of Scotland; the</p>
<p>principal offices in that kingdom were given to Englishmen; the more</p>
<p>powerful Scottish Nobles were obliged to come and live in England; the</p>
<p>Scottish crown and sceptre were brought away; and even the old stone</p>
<p>chair was carried off and placed in Westminster Abbey, where you may</p>
<p>see it now. Baliol had the Tower of London lent him for a residence,</p>
<p>with permission to range about within a circle of twenty miles. Three</p>
<p>years afterwards he was allowed to go to Normandy, where he had</p>
<p>estates, and where he passed the remaining six years of his life: far</p>
<p>more happily, I dare say, than he had lived for a long while in angry</p>
<p>Scotland.</p>
<p>Now, there was, in the West of Scotland, a gentleman of small fortune,</p>
<p>named William Wallace, the second son of a Scottish knight. He was a</p>
<p>man of great size and great strength; he was very brave and daring;</p>
<p>when he spoke to a body of his countrymen, he could rouse them in a</p>
<p>wonderful manner by the power of his burning words; he loved Scotland</p>
<p>dearly, and he hated England with his utmost might. The domineering</p>
<p>conduct of the English who now held the places of trust in Scotland</p>
<p>made them as intolerable to the proud Scottish people as they had been,</p>
<p>under similar circumstances, to the Welsh; and no man in all Scotland</p>
<p>regarded them with so much smothered rage as William Wallace. One day,</p>
<p>an Englishman in office, little knowing what he was, affronted _him_.</p>
<p>Wallace instantly struck him dead, and taking refuge among the rocks</p>
<p>and hills, and there joining with his countryman, Sir William Douglas,</p>
<p>who was also in arms against King Edward, became the most resolute and</p>
<p>undaunted champion of a people struggling for their independence that</p>
<p>ever lived upon the earth.</p>
<p>The English Guardian of the Kingdom fled before him, and, thus</p>
<p>encouraged, the Scottish people revolted everywhere, and fell upon the</p>
<p>English without mercy. The Earl of Surrey, by the King’s commands,</p>
<p>raised all the power of the Border-counties, and two English armies</p>
<p>poured into Scotland. Only one Chief, in the face of those armies,</p>
<p>stood by Wallace, who, with a force of forty thousand men, awaited the</p>
<p>invaders at a place on the river Forth, within two miles of Stirling.</p>
<p>Across the river there was only one poor wooden bridge, called the</p>
<p>bridge of Kildean—so narrow, that but two men could cross it abreast.</p>
<p>With his eyes upon this bridge, Wallace posted the greater part of his</p>
<p>men among some rising grounds, and waited calmly. When the English army</p>
<p>came up on the opposite bank of the river, messengers were sent forward</p>
<p>to offer terms. Wallace sent them back with a defiance, in the name of</p>
<p>the freedom of Scotland. Some of the officers of the Earl of Surrey in</p>
<p>command of the English, with _their_ eyes also on the bridge, advised</p>
<p>him to be discreet and not hasty. He, however, urged to immediate</p>
<p>battle by some other officers, and particularly by Cressingham, King</p>
<p>Edward’s treasurer, and a rash man, gave the word of command to</p>
<p>advance. One thousand English crossed the bridge, two abreast; the</p>
<p>Scottish troops were as motionless as stone images. Two thousand</p>
<p>English crossed; three thousand, four thousand, five. Not a feather,</p>
<p>all this time, had been seen to stir among the Scottish bonnets. Now,</p>
<p>they all fluttered. ‘Forward, one party, to the foot of the Bridge!’</p>
<p>cried Wallace, ‘and let no more English cross! The rest, down with me</p>
<p>on the five thousand who have come over, and cut them all to pieces!’</p>
<p>It was done, in the sight of the whole remainder of the English army,</p>
<p>who could give no help. Cressingham himself was killed, and the Scotch</p>
<p>made whips for their horses of his skin.</p>
<p>King Edward was abroad at this time, and during the successes on the</p>
<p>Scottish side which followed, and which enabled bold Wallace to win the</p>
<p>whole country back again, and even to ravage the English borders. But,</p>
<p>after a few winter months, the King returned, and took the field with</p>
<p>more than his usual energy. One night, when a kick from his horse as</p>
<p>they both lay on the ground together broke two of his ribs, and a cry</p>
<p>arose that he was killed, he leaped into his saddle, regardless of the</p>
<p>pain he suffered, and rode through the camp. Day then appearing, he</p>
<p>gave the word (still, of course, in that bruised and aching state)</p>
<p>Forward! and led his army on to near Falkirk, where the Scottish forces</p>
<p>were seen drawn up on some stony ground, behind a morass. Here, he</p>
<p>defeated Wallace, and killed fifteen thousand of his men. With the</p>
<p>shattered remainder, Wallace drew back to Stirling; but, being pursued,</p>
<p>set fire to the town that it might give no help to the English, and</p>
<p>escaped. The inhabitants of Perth afterwards set fire to their houses</p>
<p>for the same reason, and the King, unable to find provisions, was</p>
<p>forced to withdraw his army.</p>
<p>Another Robert Bruce, the grandson of him who had disputed the Scottish</p>
<p>crown with Baliol, was now in arms against the King (that elder Bruce</p>
<p>being dead), and also John Comyn, Baliol’s nephew. These two young men</p>
<p>might agree in opposing Edward, but could agree in nothing else, as</p>
<p>they were rivals for the throne of Scotland. Probably it was because</p>
<p>they knew this, and knew what troubles must arise even if they could</p>
<p>hope to get the better of the great English King, that the principal</p>
<p>Scottish people applied to the Pope for his interference. The Pope, on</p>
<p>the principle of losing nothing for want of trying to get it, very</p>
<p>coolly claimed that Scotland belonged to him; but this was a little too</p>
<p>much, and the Parliament in a friendly manner told him so.</p>
<p>In the spring time of the year one thousand three hundred and three,</p>
<p>the King sent Sir John Segrave, whom he made Governor of Scotland, with</p>
<p>twenty thousand men, to reduce the rebels. Sir John was not as careful</p>
<p>as he should have been, but encamped at Rosslyn, near Edinburgh, with</p>
<p>his army divided into three parts. The Scottish forces saw their</p>
<p>advantage; fell on each part separately; defeated each; and killed all</p>
<p>the prisoners. Then, came the King himself once more, as soon as a</p>
<p>great army could be raised; he passed through the whole north of</p>
<p>Scotland, laying waste whatsoever came in his way; and he took up his</p>
<p>winter quarters at Dunfermline. The Scottish cause now looked so</p>
<p>hopeless, that Comyn and the other nobles made submission and received</p>
<p>their pardons. Wallace alone stood out. He was invited to surrender,</p>
<p>though on no distinct pledge that his life should be spared; but he</p>
<p>still defied the ireful King, and lived among the steep crags of the</p>
<p>Highland glens, where the eagles made their nests, and where the</p>
<p>mountain torrents roared, and the white snow was deep, and the bitter</p>
<p>winds blew round his unsheltered head, as he lay through many a</p>
<p>pitch-dark night wrapped up in his plaid. Nothing could break his</p>
<p>spirit; nothing could lower his courage; nothing could induce him to</p>
<p>forget or to forgive his country’s wrongs. Even when the Castle of</p>
<p>Stirling, which had long held out, was besieged by the King with every</p>
<p>kind of military engine then in use; even when the lead upon cathedral</p>
<p>roofs was taken down to help to make them; even when the King, though</p>
<p>an old man, commanded in the siege as if he were a youth, being so</p>
<p>resolved to conquer; even when the brave garrison (then found with</p>
<p>amazement to be not two hundred people, including several ladies) were</p>
<p>starved and beaten out and were made to submit on their knees, and with</p>
<p>every form of disgrace that could aggravate their sufferings; even</p>
<p>then, when there was not a ray of hope in Scotland, William Wallace was</p>
<p>as proud and firm as if he had beheld the powerful and relentless</p>
<p>Edward lying dead at his feet.</p>
<p>Who betrayed William Wallace in the end, is not quite certain. That he</p>
<p>was betrayed—probably by an attendant—is too true. He was taken to the</p>
<p>Castle of Dumbarton, under Sir John Menteith, and thence to London,</p>
<p>where the great fame of his bravery and resolution attracted immense</p>
<p>concourses of people to behold him. He was tried in Westminster Hall,</p>
<p>with a crown of laurel on his head—it is supposed because he was</p>
<p>reported to have said that he ought to wear, or that he would wear, a</p>
<p>crown there and was found guilty as a robber, a murderer, and a</p>
<p>traitor. What they called a robber (he said to those who tried him) he</p>
<p>was, because he had taken spoil from the King’s men. What they called a</p>
<p>murderer, he was, because he had slain an insolent Englishman. What</p>
<p>they called a traitor, he was not, for he had never sworn allegiance to</p>
<p>the King, and had ever scorned to do it. He was dragged at the tails of</p>
<p>horses to West Smithfield, and there hanged on a high gallows, torn</p>
<p>open before he was dead, beheaded, and quartered. His head was set upon</p>
<p>a pole on London Bridge, his right arm was sent to Newcastle, his left</p>
<p>arm to Berwick, his legs to Perth and Aberdeen. But, if King Edward had</p>
<p>had his body cut into inches, and had sent every separate inch into a</p>
<p>separate town, he could not have dispersed it half so far and wide as</p>
<p>his fame. Wallace will be remembered in songs and stories, while there</p>
<p>are songs and stories in the English tongue, and Scotland will hold him</p>
<p>dear while her lakes and mountains last.</p>
<p>Released from this dreaded enemy, the King made a fairer plan of</p>
<p>Government for Scotland, divided the offices of honour among Scottish</p>
<p>gentlemen and English gentlemen, forgave past offences, and thought, in</p>
<p>his old age, that his work was done.</p>
<p>But he deceived himself. Comyn and Bruce conspired, and made an</p>
<p>appointment to meet at Dumfries, in the church of the Minorites. There</p>
<p>is a story that Comyn was false to Bruce, and had informed against him</p>
<p>to the King; that Bruce was warned of his danger and the necessity of</p>
<p>flight, by receiving, one night as he sat at supper, from his friend</p>
<p>the Earl of Gloucester, twelve pennies and a pair of spurs; that as he</p>
<p>was riding angrily to keep his appointment (through a snow-storm, with</p>
<p>his horse’s shoes reversed that he might not be tracked), he met an</p>
<p>evil-looking serving man, a messenger of Comyn, whom he killed, and</p>
<p>concealed in whose dress he found letters that proved Comyn’s</p>
<p>treachery. However this may be, they were likely enough to quarrel in</p>
<p>any case, being hot-headed rivals; and, whatever they quarrelled about,</p>
<p>they certainly did quarrel in the church where they met, and Bruce drew</p>
<p>his dagger and stabbed Comyn, who fell upon the pavement. When Bruce</p>
<p>came out, pale and disturbed, the friends who were waiting for him</p>
<p>asked what was the matter? ‘I think I have killed Comyn,’ said he. ‘You</p>
<p>only think so?’ returned one of them; ‘I will make sure!’ and going</p>
<p>into the church, and finding him alive, stabbed him again and again.</p>
<p>Knowing that the King would never forgive this new deed of violence,</p>
<p>the party then declared Bruce King of Scotland: got him crowned at</p>
<p>Scone—without the chair; and set up the rebellious standard once again.</p>
<p>When the King heard of it he kindled with fiercer anger than he had</p>
<p>ever shown yet. He caused the Prince of Wales and two hundred and</p>
<p>seventy of the young nobility to be knighted—the trees in the Temple</p>
<p>Gardens were cut down to make room for their tents, and they watched</p>
<p>their armour all night, according to the old usage: some in the Temple</p>
<p>Church: some in Westminster Abbey—and at the public Feast which then</p>
<p>took place, he swore, by Heaven, and by two swans covered with gold</p>
<p>network which his minstrels placed upon the table, that he would avenge</p>
<p>the death of Comyn, and would punish the false Bruce. And before all</p>
<p>the company, he charged the Prince his son, in case that he should die</p>
<p>before accomplishing his vow, not to bury him until it was fulfilled.</p>
<p>Next morning the Prince and the rest of the young Knights rode away to</p>
<p>the Border-country to join the English army; and the King, now weak and</p>
<p>sick, followed in a horse-litter.</p>
<p>Bruce, after losing a battle and undergoing many dangers and much</p>
<p>misery, fled to Ireland, where he lay concealed through the winter.</p>
<p>That winter, Edward passed in hunting down and executing Bruce’s</p>
<p>relations and adherents, sparing neither youth nor age, and showing no</p>
<p>touch of pity or sign of mercy. In the following spring, Bruce</p>
<p>reappeared and gained some victories. In these frays, both sides were</p>
<p>grievously cruel. For instance—Bruce’s two brothers, being taken</p>
<p>captives desperately wounded, were ordered by the King to instant</p>
<p>execution. Bruce’s friend Sir John Douglas, taking his own Castle of</p>
<p>Douglas out of the hands of an English Lord, roasted the dead bodies of</p>
<p>the slaughtered garrison in a great fire made of every movable within</p>
<p>it; which dreadful cookery his men called the Douglas Larder. Bruce,</p>
<p>still successful, however, drove the Earl of Pembroke and the Earl of</p>
<p>Gloucester into the Castle of Ayr and laid siege to it.</p>
<p>The King, who had been laid up all the winter, but had directed the</p>
<p>army from his sick-bed, now advanced to Carlisle, and there, causing</p>
<p>the litter in which he had travelled to be placed in the Cathedral as</p>
<p>an offering to Heaven, mounted his horse once more, and for the last</p>
<p>time. He was now sixty-nine years old, and had reigned thirty-five</p>
<p>years. He was so ill, that in four days he could go no more than six</p>
<p>miles; still, even at that pace, he went on and resolutely kept his</p>
<p>face towards the Border. At length, he lay down at the village of</p>
<p>Burgh-upon-Sands; and there, telling those around him to impress upon</p>
<p>the Prince that he was to remember his father’s vow, and was never to</p>
<p>rest until he had thoroughly subdued Scotland, he yielded up his last</p>
<p>breath.</p>
