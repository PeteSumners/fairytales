<img alt="FRANCIE FISHER'S FISH By Marion Malette Thornton" height="164" src="images/p1_fish.jpg" width="600" id="img_images_p1_fish.jpg">
</div>
<p>On the Primary Room wall was a beautiful picture of a shining river.
Francie loved to count the fish that were swimming in it. Just
fourteen there were, and every one stood for a new scholar someone had
brought into the Primary Class.</p>
<p>How Francie wished he could bring one and have Miss Florence pin a
fish in the river and a red tag on his blouse to show that he had
caught it.</p>
<p>“How you s'pose I can get a fish, mother?” he asked earnestly. “I
should think a Fisher-boy ought to be able to catch just one.”</p>
<p>Mother shook her head. “I don't know, I'm sure. There isn't a child on
this street who doesn't go to Sunday-school.”</p>
<p>“P'r'aps one will move on,” said Francie hopefully.</p>
<p>But when a new family did move to that street there were no children
in it.</p>
<p>One day Francie came flying into the house. “Oh. mother, the ash-man's
here and I b'lieve he's got a fish with him!”</p>
<p>“What?” exclaimed mother, but when she looked out she understood.
Sitting in the ash-man's cart was a pretty little boy, with black eyes
and tight curly hair.</p>
<p>“Is he yours. Mr. Lugi?” mother asked, and the ash-man smiled and
nodded:</p>
<p>“Yes. mine—my Rafael.”</p>
<p>“Does he go to Sunday-school?” put in Francie eagerly.</p>
<p>“No, no school—too little, him.”</p>
<p>“Oh, but it's just Sundays and we sing and there's pictures. Couldn't
he please go with me. Mr. Lugi?” begged Francie, “I'll take awful good
care of him.”</p>
<p>Mother explained a little more, and at last Mr. Lugi said Rafael might
go, only—“No dress up, no clothes,” he said sadly.</p>
<p>But that did not trouble Francie. “Why, he can have my brown suit,
can't he, mother? I'd just as soon.”</p>
<p>The next day mother took Francie down to see Mrs. Lugi. Little Rafael
was shy at first, but he soon got over it and was friendly as could
be. The little black-eyed Italian mother was very glad to see them.</p>
<p>“I like Rafael go the Christ-church,” she said. “I use go myself,
home—Italy.”</p>
<p>The brown suit, too small for Francie, was just right for Rafael, and
it would have been hard to find two happier little boys than Francie
and his fish when they walked into the Primary class together.</p>
<p>Rafael clapped his hands with the rest when Miss Florence pinned the
fish in the river and the red tag on Francie's blouse.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Illustration: Miss Florence pinned the fish in the river and the red tag on Francie's blouse" height="600" src="images/p1_florence.jpg" width="488" id="img_images_p1_florence.jpg">
</div>
<p>And what do you think? Out in the big room there were two more new
fish, one in Mother Fisher's class and one in Father Fisher's. They
were Mr. Lugi and the little Italian mother, come to Sunday-school
with their little boy.</p>
<p>“Really and truly,” Francie said, “seem's if I caught three fish
'stead of one.”</p>
<p>“Really and truly,” said Mother Fisher, “I think you did.”</p>
<hr>
<h3>“ALL BY HERSELF.”</h3>
<p>The older children were gone out for the day: mamma was busy in the
sewing room with Miss Fay: Molly was doing the Saturday baking. “What
could Alice do all by herself?”</p>
<p>This was the very question that popped into the wee girl's own head,
and she trotted off to ask mamma.</p>
<p>“Here's I,” she said, at the sewing room door. “Here's I, all by
myself. What's I goin' do, mamma?”</p>
<p>“Going to be mamma's good little daughter and amuse yourself this
morning without help from anybody. See how busy I am.”</p>
<p>“Everybody's busy that isn't gone way off,” said Alice dolefully.</p>
<p>“Well, then,” said mamma. “Alice must be busy, too, taking care of
herself and making her own good times. See how well she can do it.</p>
<p>“But first of all,” mamma went on, “think what you would like to do or
to have me get for you, and I'll stop a minute now for that, so as to
start you.”</p>
<p>This was an important thing to decide, so Alice went into the next
room and sat down in her kindergarten chair before her table, to think
it out. She folded her arms and sat still about a minute: then she ran
to mamma, exclaiming. “I know now, please get me my snub scissors” (of
course she meant round-pointed) “and some bright paper, and I'll cut
and cut ever so long.”</p>
<p>Mamma dropped her work and got the things. “Now, dear,” she said, “see
if you can't get along the rest of the morning by yourself. Dolly and
the picture books are in the dining room. Don't ask me for anything if
you can help it, but keep out of mischief and be as happy as you can.”</p>
<p>Alice went back to her little table and soon had it covered with queer
things. There were the oddest dolls you ever saw, with arms sticking
out like stems: and there were horses with as many legs as could be
put along the whole length of the body. It was great fun to cut them.</p>
<p>But by and by Alice grew tired of this, and jumped up quickly. Over
went the little table, scattering things everywhere. Such a litter!
“I'll just leave it all,” thought Alice. Then a little voice inside
said. “Pick it all up and help mamma.” After a minute, the little girl
obeyed this pleasant voice, and picked up every scrap. Then she ran
downstairs without stopping at the sewing room door, though she wanted
to.</p>
<p>“Peggy Morlinda,” she said, taking dolly from her cradle, “is you all
by yourself, too? Isn't it lonesome? Come, I'll put you to sleep.”</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Illustration: “Peggy Morlinda, is you all by yourself, too?”" height="378" src="images/p2_peggy.gif" width="450" id="img_images_p2_peggy.gif">
</div>
<p>Peggy was soon asleep, or supposed to be, though her eyes were still
staring.</p>
<p>“Now I will go take one little peek at mamma.” said Alice, starting
upstairs, but stopping next step. “No. I won't neiver,” she said
bravely. “I won't 'sturb mamma one bit.”</p>
<p>After this the little girl found amusement for awhile at the library
window. Next, she went back to the picture books, and read a long
story, all made up out of her own head, to Peggy Morlinda, who woke
up to listen. But what a long morning it was! She did not enjoy it
much, but she made up her mind about one thing—she wouldn't “'sturb
mamma.”</p>
<p>At last papa came home and Alice ran to him to be tossed up and down,
and they had a fine frolic.</p>
<p>“Have you gotten along nicely with your work?” asked papa of mamma at
dinner.</p>
<p>“Very nicely, thank you,” said mamma. “Alice helped me a great deal!”</p>
<p>“Alice!” exclaimed papa, looking as surprised as possible. “Can Alice
sew?”</p>
<p>Mamma laughed. “Oh, no, indeed, not yet,” she said, “but she gave me a
fine chance to do it. She amused herself all morning and did not ask
me to do anything for her, so we got on beautifully with the work in
the sewing room.”</p>
<p>“Good girl,” said papa, and Alice looked as happy as she felt. Oh, how
glad she was that she had not left those scraps of paper for mamma to
pick up! It is always safe to listen to the little inward voice that
says, “Do right.”</p>
<p>“Do tell me a story,” “What can I play?” “What shall I do next?” the
little folks cry to the grown-ups, and all these things take time to
attend to. If the children who are too small to do any work to “help
mamma,” would oftener amuse themselves, as Alice did, they would help
much more than perhaps they think.—<i>Written for Dew Drops by Mary

<img alt="Why Betty Changed Her Mind By Marie Deacon Hanson" height="138" src="images/p2_betty.gif" width="700" id="img_images_p2_betty.gif">
</div>
<p>Each day, on her way to school, Betty called for Robbie Porter. There
were two reasons why she did this. One was that she had promised Mrs.
Porter she would, the other was that the little boy's mother always
gave Betty a cooky, or a piece of candy, or sometimes a penny. Betty
never wanted anyone to know about this second reason, which made her
feel ashamed of herself, whenever she thought of it.</p>
<p>“Just as if you couldn't do a kind thing for your neighbor without
expecting to get something for doing it,” she would say scornfully to
herself.</p>
<p>One afternoon, Mrs. Porter met Betty in the grocery, and said to her:
“Deary, shall you mind calling for Robbie about ten minutes earlier in
the morning? I want to go to the city on the eight-thirty train.” And
before Betty could answer, she added. “Of course, Robbie could go by
himself now that he has learned the way, but he does so enjoy going
with you.”</p>
<p>“And I don't mind one bit calling for him,” Betty hastened to assure
Mrs. Porter. “I'll come early in the morning.”</p>
<p>On the way home from the store. Betty saw her cousin, Julia Norton,
coming eagerly to meet her.</p>
<p>“Betty,” Julia cried, “mother sent me to ask you to stay all night.
Cousin Lottie has come, and mother says we can pop corn and have a
good time. And you must be sure to bring your books so you can go
right to school in the morning from our house.”</p>
<p>“That will be lovely,” Betty exclaimed delightedly. There were few
treats she enjoyed more than going to her aunt's home.</p>
<p>Julia ran off to speak to another girl, and Betty following, suddenly
remembered Robbie. Mow could she call for him if she were at her
aunt's?</p>
<p>The latter lived on the other side of the village, and it would be far
out of Betty's way to call for Robbie.</p>
<p>“I just won't bother about him,” she decided.</p>
<p>But even as she did so, she remembered that she had not only promised
to call for Robbie in the morning, but to call for him earlier than
usual and his mother would depend upon her.</p>
<p>“Oh, dear! What shall I do?” Betty cried impatiently.</p>
<p>A small voice seemed to answer in her ear, and it sounded so real that
Betty actually turned to see if the owner were near: “Do as you would
be done by.”</p>
<p>“Why, that's the Golden Rule,” Betty quickly exclaimed. “And mother
says if you do as the Golden Rule tells you, you'll never be unhappy.
What does it tell me to do now?” She stood in thought for a moment,
and the next, she ran to overtake her cousin.</p>
<p>“Julia, please give this sugar to mother,” Betty said, placing the
bag in her cousin's band. “And tell her that I've gone to Mrs.
Porter's and I'll be right back.”</p>
<p>Betty flew down the street to Mrs. Porter's and knocked hurriedly on
the door.</p>
<p>“Why, Betty, what is it, dear?” Mrs. Porter asked in surprise, as the
former rushed into the room, in response to the invitation to enter.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Illustration: “I'm sorry I can't call for Robbie in the morning.”" height="600" src="images/p2_robbie.gif" width="468" id="img_images_p2_robbie.gif">
</div>
<p>“I'm sorry I can't call for Robbie in the morning. I'm going to Aunt
Fanny's to stay all night,” Betty explained breathlessly.</p>
<p>“It is thoughtful of you to come and tell me now, dear,” Mrs. Porter
replied. “I'll ask Jennie Lee to stop for Robbie in the morning. I
hope you will have a nice visit at your aunt's.”</p>
<p>“I know I shall,” Betty answered happily. “I'll call for Robbie the
next day, Mrs. Porter.” And away the little girl tripped,
light-hearted as could be. That is the way it makes one feel to follow
the Golden Rule.</p>

<h3>JACK'S MASTER.</h3>
<p>Jack's most delightful present last Christmas was a red wooden gun,
with arrows that would shoot very hard indeed. At least Jack thought
it was delightful, but his mamma did not; those little pointed wooden
arrows that flew so far and hit so hard made her very uneasy, for fear
her little boy would presently hurt somebody.</p>
<p>But mammas hate to spoil their little boys' fun, and Jack's mamma made
an arrangement by which it was agreed that he was to have his gun,
provided that he never pointed it at anybody, even in play.</p>
<p>Jack was quick enough to promise; he meant to keep his promise, too;
and I think would have kept it if it hadn't been for his master. You
didn't know Jack had a master? No more did he know it till the day he
had to give up his gun.</p>
<p>You see, Jack had a little brother, two years younger than himself,
who was a very spirit of mischief, and loved above all things to tease
big Jack. One day, when the two boys were playing together, pretending
to be wild Indians out in the woods. Will began to tease Jack by
saying: “There was a little man, and he had a little gun,” and all the
rest of that little song. I don't know why this teased Jack, but he
got madder and madder, until, alas! in spite of his promise, he
pointed his gun—not at the “duck—duck—duck,” but at Will, and
struck him on the cheek.</p>
<p>Now it was not the wooden arrow with which his gun was loaded this
time, but one leg of a sharp steel hairpin, and it went into the cheek
and stuck there like a little dagger.</p>
<p>Half an hour later the red gun was in ashes on mamma's hearth, while
mamma herself and both boys sat sorrowfully by its grave.</p>
<p>“Mamma,” said Jack, “I didn't mean to shoot Will, but somehow I
couldn't help it.”</p>
<p>“No,” said mamma, shaking her head: “I forgot when I let you keep the
gun that you had a master.”</p>
<p>“A master?” asked Jack, in surprise.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said mamma, “you obey Bad Temper's orders, though you don't
always obey mine.”</p>
<p>“Mamma,” said Jack, presently, “I think I'll leave Bad Temper's
service. He gets me into a heap of trouble.”</p>
<p>“Do, Jack,” she said, smiling brightly at him. “And while you are
getting rid of a bad master, remember that you have a good one, the
Lord Jesus, on whose banner is written, ‘Putting away all wrath and
clamor.’”</p>
<p>Little Will listened very soberly to all this, with a red hole in his
cheek, and both chubby hands resting on his bare knees. I hope he made
up his mind, too, to choose the good Master.—<i>Selected</i>.</p>

<h3>LUCILE'S SURPRISE.</h3>
<p>It was a bitter cold day in January, so cold that the children ran all
the way to school. It was snowing, too, and blowing as hard as it
could. A very small crowd was in the classroom that morning, and
everyone began to wonder why.</p>
<p>“Not on account of the cold, surely,” declared Edith Watts. “Why, it's
just fine to be out to-day. And I know Lucile would never stay away
because it was cold. She has too much spunk for that.”</p>
<p>But still Lucile didn't come, and everyone wondered: for she never was
sick, and had said nothing the day before about staying away.</p>
<p>At the last moment Polly Dalton came hurrying in, saying, “Girls'
there's a scarlet fever sign on Dayres' door, so Lucile must be sick.
The nun was putting the sign up as I came by.”</p>
<p>Later in the day it was found that several other children had fever,
or were afraid to come out lest they should get it, so the Hill School
was closed for a week. Edith Watts was very lonely without her little
friend, and spent much of her time writing letters to her, or in
thinking of nice things to do for her.</p>
<p>“I wish I could think of something very, <i>very</i> sweet to do for her,
something that would make her happy all the time,” she said. “It must
be so lonely and stupid for her to stay in the same room all the time,
never seeing any other children.”</p>
<p>“Keep thinking about it and the right thought will come to you,” mamma
told her, and mamma's advice turned out to be right, as usual.</p>
<p>Two days later, Edith came downstairs, her face shining.</p>
<p>“I know, mamma. I know what will make Lucile happy every day in the
whole six weeks she must stay in the house. The kittens! I will give
her my kittens. It has been nearly two weeks since she has seen them,
and they have grown so much and their fur has fluffed out so
beautifully she will hardly know them.”</p>
<p>And the kittens were lovely. Who wouldn't want a present like that?
Edith loved them with all her heart, but she didn't for one minute
want to keep them for herself when she knew they would make Lucile
happy. She put them carefully in a basket, covering them well to keep
out the cold. A nice Indian hanging-basket that she had used for a
swing for the pets was packed, too, and then papa took the “happy
thought,” as mamma called it, to Lucile's home.</p>
<p>“Remember, it must be a surprise for her,” his small daughter reminded
him as he left the house. “I want her to awaken from a nap and find
the kittens swinging in the basket just where she can see them.”</p>

</div>
<h4>“I want her to awaken from a nap and find the kittens
swinging in the basket.”</h4>
<p>And that is the way Lucile saw them. If they ever had looked sweet to
Edith's eyes, they looked a thousand times more so to Lucile's poor,
tired ones.</p>
<p>“Oh-h-h!” she exclaimed, with a long-drawn, happy sigh. “You darling
darlings! Have you come to stay, or are you only visitors?”</p>
<p>The basket with its dainty load hung from a picture-hook near by, and
the new-comers looked quite contented to stay. They jumped into the
bed and did all they knew to cure the little girl. And they really
helped.—<i>Written for Dew Drops by Elizabeth Roberts Burton</i>.</p>

<h3>When Lapland Babies Go to Church.</h3>
<p>When Sunday morning comes, the Lapland father harnesses his reindeer
to the sleigh. Father and mother wrap themselves in fur coats and put
a fur coat on the baby, and away they go over the snow to church, it
may be ten or even fifteen miles, for the reindeer can go a good deal
faster than a horse.</p>
<p>But the old Lapland custom of caring for the babies while the grown
people are in church, you never would guess. For as soon as the
reindeer is made secure, the father Lapp shovels out a snug little bed
in the snow, and when it is ready the mother Lapp wraps the baby snug
and warm in skins and lays it down there. Then the father Lapp piles
the snow around and over the baby, when they go into the church and
leave the baby in the snow. So common is this that sometimes there are
twenty or thirty babies, down to the little wee-est ones, buried in
snow around the church.</p>
<p>You might think the babies would suffocate, but they do not, nor do
they freeze. In fact, the snow does not make them cold. For when it
covers anyone all over, if they have clothes enough on, so the snow
will not melt and wet them, it will keep them warm. And as the little
Lapland babies are not strong enough to knock the snow away and let in
the cold, they just lie there safe and warm and go to sleep.</p>
<p>When church is out the father Lapp goes to the spot where his baby is,
puts his hands down into the snow, pulls the baby our and shakes the
snow off it; then the reindeer is unfastened, father and mother tuck
themselves and the baby in the sleigh, and over the snow away they
trot home again.—<i>Written for Dew Drops by Adele E. Thompson.</i></p>

<h3>MOTHER HULDA'S FEATHER BED.</h3>
<p>How many children know what the boys and girls of far-off Norway
sometimes think when they see the dainty, feathery snowflakes flying
softly and silently through the air? I don't think there are many of
you who do know, so I will tell you the story.</p>
<p>If we were there when they have the first snowstorm of the season we
could hear them shouting gleefully to each other: “See! oh, see!
Mother Hulda is shaking her feather bed.”</p>
<p>There is a story about this Mother Hulda and her feather bed that is
told to the little ones there. She lives, it is said, far, far above
this busy world, with the clouds for her home, the sun for a lamp and
fire.</p>
<p>She is always very busy, and especially so at the beginning of the
winter, for then she has to unpack her great feather bed, and after
that is done she spends all of her time shaking it. Indeed she shakes
it so much that she wears many holes in it, through which the feathers
fly in all directions. The wind catches them up and carries them
gently to the earth, where they cover the bare limbs of the trees,
making them beautiful, and where they spread lightly on the ground and
protect the roots of the flowers from the cold winter winds.</p>
<p>Mother Hulda does not tire of shaking her bed until the warmer spring
winds begin to blow; then she packs it away until she sees Jack Frost
traveling again over the world below, and finds traces of the
mischievous fellow even in her lofty home.—<i>Selected</i>.</p>

<h3>The Difference it Made.</h3>
<p>“What a sweet voice that little child in the red cloak has!” said a
visitor in Sunday-school to a teacher, as together they listened to
the children raising their song of praise.</p>
<p>“Yes, isn't it sweet? And she always sings just so heartily,” was the
reply.</p>
<p>A little later, the school closed and, the children on their way
home, the visitor chanced to pass by the child in the red cloak, just
in time to hear her say angrily to her nurse, who had called for her:</p>
<p>“I don't want to go this way—I want to go through the park. I won't!
I won't go through that horrid old street!”</p>
<p>“But, Miss Mazie, your mamma said we were to go straight home and not
stay in the park to-day.”</p>
<p>Upon this, the little lady marched away, with pouting lips and injured
mien.</p>
<p>“Ah,” thought the lady, “what a difference it makes in the voice when
one speaks angrily! No matter how sweet it may be, how harsh and
unloving angry words make it!”</p>
<p>What a pity that Mazie did not keep her voice as musical and birdlike
as it was when she was singing her morning song of praise! Think of
this, little readers, and when you are tempted to be angry and speak
in cross tones, instead of making your voice unpleasant to hear,
endeavor to make it sweet and loving.</p>

<h3>The Earnest Mother.</h3>
<p>Mothers seldom realize the influence they exert in molding the lives
of their children. It is the faithful teaching, as well as the
consistent practicing of an earnest mother which results in forming
characters of nobility and uprightness in the sons and daughters. The
work cannot be begun too early. From their very birth, our children
receive impressions. What the character of these impressions is
depends upon surrounding influences. A true mother's influence should
last long after she is at rest. Said Thomas H. Benton: “My mother
asked me never to use tobacco; I have never touched it from that time
to the present day. She asked me not to gamble, and I have never
gambled, and I cannot tell who is losing in games that are being
played. She admonished me, too, against hard drinking, and whatever
capacity for endurance I have at present, and whatever usefulness I
may have attained in life, I have attributed to having complied with
her pious and correct wishes. When I was seven years of age she asked
me not to drink, and then I made a resolution of total abstinence; and
that I have adhered to it through all time, I owe to my mother.”</p>
<p>Mothers, do not think your little ones are too young to receive
advice; it is true they may not act upon it for many years, but they
will remember it and follow it sometime.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
